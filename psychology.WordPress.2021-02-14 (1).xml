<p>This website is made by <strong><a href="mailto:sycho.roshan@gmail.com" data-type="mailto" data-id="mailto:sycho.roshan@gmail.com">Roshan Kumar</a></strong> for study of psychology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Psychology</strong> is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as feeling and thought. It is an academic discipline of immense scope. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, and all the variety of phenomena linked to those emergent properties, joining this way the broader neuro-scientific group of researchers. As a social science, it aims to understand individuals and groups by establishing general principles and researching specific cases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this field, a professional practitioner or researcher is called a psychologist and can be classified as a social, behavioral, or cognitive scientist. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the physiological and biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychologists explore behavior and mental processes, including perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation, brain functioning, and personality. This extends to interaction between people, such as interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind. Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some—especially clinical and counseling psychologists—at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a "hub science" in that medicine tends to draw psychological research via neurology and psychiatry, whereas social sciences most commonly draw directly from sub-disciplines within psychology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. The majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior, and typically work in university psychology departments or teach in other academic settings (e.g., medical schools, hospitals). Some are employed in industrial and organizational settings, or in other areas such as human development and aging, sports, health, and the media, as well as in forensic investigation and other aspects of law.</p>

<p>OLD SCHOOL, NEW SCHOOL<br>GLOSSARY<br>anthropology The study of humankind. Areas covered include the origins and<br>development of the human species, its biological characteristics, belief structures<br>and social customs. Although the subject was discussed by Herodotus as long<br>ago as 500 BC, it only became a discipline in its own right during the<br>Renaissance, with the writings of Michel de Montaigne, René Descartes and<br>Immanuel Kant. The term comes from the Greek anthropos (human) and logos<br>(science) and was coined in Germany in the sixteenth century.<br>consciousness The totality of experience of which a person is aware at any one<br>moment. This is a constantly shifting state, moving between current thought<br>processes, memory, visual and aural stimuli and physical experiences. The US<br>psychologist William James said consciousness was like a stream, constantly<br>chopping and changing direction, but essentially continuous.<br>Ego According to Freud, this is the conscious, rational part of personality. He<br>saw the human psyche as being made up of three parts: the Id, which seeks<br>instant gratification, the Superego, which makes moral judgments, and the Ego,<br>which mediates between the first two. It does so using the ‘reality principle’,<br>which compels us to abide by current social norms. Freud said the Id was like a<br>horse and the Ego like a man riding the horse and controlling its wilder instincts.<br>Id According to Freud, this is the instinctive, unconscious aspect of human<br>personality that seeks immediate gratification. Its primitive impulses are<br>restrained and controlled by the Ego. Although the Id is often associated with<br>negative and antisocial behaviour, it is also responsible for instincts that are<br>essential for our survival, such as hunger and thirst, as well as the reproductive<br>urge.<br>neuroscience The study of the nervous system, including the brain functions and<br>how they relate to human behaviour. Ultimately the task of neuroscientists is to<br>discover the functions of all parts of the brain, what mental processes they<br>perform and how they are affected by external stimuli. Once a branch of biology,<br>it is now regarded as an interdisciplinary science which covers several other<br>disciplines, such as psychology, medicine and computer science.<br>neurosis A mild mental disorder characterized by anxiety and phobias, but not<br>so extreme that the patient suffers from delusions or hallucinations. According to<br>Freud, the condition is part of the Ego’s self-defence mechanism and is triggered<br>by unresolved inner conflicts. Although once a common diagnosis, the term is no<br>longer used in mainstream psychiatry, apart from specific use in psychoanalytic<br>practice and theory.<br>neurotic A person who suffers from neurosis, or having the symptoms of<br>neurosis. Symptoms include hysteria, obsessive-compulsiveness and a long list<br>of phobias, such as agoraphobia (fear of having a panic attack in a public space)<br>and arachnophobia (fear of spiders).<br>pathogenic Causing disease, or being capable of causing disease. From the<br>Greek pathos (disease) and genesis (creation).<br>personality conflict A clash between different aspects of someone’s personality.<br>According to Freud, the primitive instincts of the Id are in constant conflict with<br>the self-conscious moralizing of the Superego and have to be mediated by the<br>rationalism of the Ego. If this conflict is unresolved, it can lead to neurosis.<br>primatology The study of primates. Although primatology is a separate<br>discipline from psychology, there is some overlap in the study of social groups<br>and aspects of personality.<br>stimulus error The tendency for patients, during ‘introspection’, to name the<br>objects they were visualizing rather than describing what those objects meant to<br>them. Thus, just stating the presence of an apple is less informative than<br>describing the shape and colour of the apple and what feelings they evoke.<br>Introspection was used in the early days of psychiatry to describe a patient’s<br>conscious mind.<br>Superego According to Freud, that part of the personality that makes moral<br>judgments and acts as our conscience. The Superego is mainly unconscious and<br>formed through the internalization of one’s parents’ and society’s moral codes.<br>An over-strong Superego can lead a person to be moralistic and uncompromising<br>towards other people.<br>WUNDT’S INTROSPECTION<br>the 30-second theory<br>Are you sitting comfortably? Now tell me, what are the contents of your<br>conscious mind right now? This is a version of introspection – the research tool<br>favoured by psychology’s founding fathers in the late nineteenth century. As<br>William James noted in his 1890 book The Principles of Psychology, ‘The word<br>introspection needs hardly to be defined – it means, of course, looking into our<br>own minds and reporting what we there discover.’ Practitioners in Wilhelm<br>Wundt’s laboratory at the University of Leipzig – widely accepted as the world’s<br>first experimental psychology lab – were expected to undergo lengthy training in<br>the method. One aim was to break conscious experience down into its<br>constituent parts. Although the technique sounds straightforward enough,<br>methodological arguments broke out among its early pioneers. Edward<br>Titchener, a British psychologist and former student of Wundt’s, proposed a<br>particularly strict system designed to avoid what he called ‘stimulus error’, in<br>which, faced with a stimulus such as a table, the ‘introspectionist’ reports the<br>mere presence of the table, rather than the raw sensory experiences provoked by<br>its colour, size, position and constitution.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The favoured research method of psychology’s founding fathers was<br>introspection – reporting the contents of one’s own consciousness.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Introspection as a formal technique fell out of favour with the rise of<br>behaviourism, and with the growing recognition that many of our mental<br>processes are beyond conscious access. However, any time a research participant<br>reports how they are feeling or describes their sensory perceptions – as often<br>happens as part of many modern psychology experiments – they are in effect<br>introspecting.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WATSON’S BEHAVIOURISM<br>PSYCHOANALYSIS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>WILLIAM JAMES<br>1842–1910<br>EDWARD TITCHENER<br>1867–1927<br>WILHELM WUNDT<br>1832–1920<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>No one has direct access to your mind like you do. That’s why introspection<br>remains a valid technique even after the invention of brain scanners.<br>WATSON’S BEHAVIOURISM<br>the 30-second theory<br>Early psychologists investigated thinking by inspecting their own thoughts<br>and the reports of the thoughts of others. The behaviourists rejected this method.<br>Science, they argued, must be based on data that everyone can agree on,<br>something reliable and objectively measurable. This means abandoning talk and<br>reports of thoughts, and concentrating on simple behaviours. Rather than rely on<br>subjective impressions, behaviourists conducted experiments in which the inputs<br>(‘stimuli’) were controlled and the outputs (‘responses’) were measured. They<br>hoped that from these experiments the relationship between the two could be<br>inferred, with no need to worry about the intervening black box of the mind. For<br>example, a rat in a cage would get a food reward every third time it pressed a<br>lever. By recording the number of times that the rat pressed the lever, over time<br>you could get an objective record of its rate of learning. Like this example, the<br>most famous findings of behaviourism are about fundamental learning<br>mechanisms that describe how associations with stimuli and responses are<br>learned due to repetition or reward. The emphasis on simple behaviours allowed<br>the behaviourists to develop theories that applied to non-human animals as well<br>as humans.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The only reliable evidence is something you can measure directly. For<br>psychology this means we should only talk about behaviour, not about mental<br>states.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Modern psychology rejects the core idea of behaviourism (that it is impossible to<br>scientifically discuss the structure of the mind). Despite this, many aspects of<br>behaviourism remain central to modern psychology. These include the emphasis<br>on recording objective measures in controlled experiments, the common study of<br>psychological phenomena in non-human animals as well as in humans and<br>psychologists’ keen interest in learning.<br>psychologists’ keen interest in learning.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WUNDT’S INTROSPECTION<br>THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION<br>PAVLOV’S DOGS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>CLARK L.

WATSON<br>1878–1958<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Tom Stafford<br>The behaviourists were uninterested in the ‘black box’ of the mind, choosing<br>to focus instead only on what is outwardly observable.<br>PSYCHOANALYSIS<br>the 30-second theory<br>Sigmund Freud conceived of and developed the concept of psychoanalysis<br>during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a means of<br>understanding behaviour. Freud believed that personality consists of three<br>components: the Id, which is governed by pleasure and seeks immediate<br>gratification; the Ego, which is concerned with making rational decisions; and<br>the Superego, which makes moral judgments. The Ego is pulled to and fro by the<br>Id and Superego, giving rise to personality conflicts. When the Ego is<br>overwhelmed by the Id’s demands, we become neurotic, and when it gives in to<br>them, the Superego punishes the Ego with guilt. The Ego copes with these<br>conflicting demands by means of neuroses and dreams, which fulfil the Id’s<br>suppressed desires, and with defence mechanisms such as repression and denial,<br>which reduce anxiety. These mechanisms can be pathogenic, however, and are a<br>major cause of mental illness. Alfred Adler and Carl Jung also contributed to<br>psychoanalysis, but parted ways with Freud in the 1910s. Jung disagreed with<br>him about the structure of personality, while Adler emphasized the importance<br>of social factors in development, and believed that people are motivated by selfpreservation, the will to power and a drive to affirm their personalities. Both also<br>rejected Freud’s emphasis on sexuality.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Unconscious motivating forces play a central role in shaping our behaviour, but<br>are also the primary cause of mental illness.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The main criticisms of Freud’s theories are that they are unfalsifiable and cannot<br>be used to make predictions about outcomes of treatment. His patients were<br>unrepresentative of the general population, and the fact that he treated very few<br>children invalidates to a degree his theory of personality development.

Cognitivism is a<br>rejection of psychoanalytic approaches, which try to understand the mind in<br>terms of myth, and of behaviourist approaches, which try to understand the mind<br>in terms of behaviour only. The start of the cognitive revolution is often dated to<br>the appearance of an incendiary book review by linguist Noam Chomsky.<br>Chomsky’s review criticized the behaviourist psychologist B.F. Skinner’s book<br>Verbal Behaviour, in which he attempted to explain language learning using<br>behaviourist principles. Cognitivism marked an evolution of behaviourism and is<br>inspired by a computer metaphor of the mind. Computers have hardware and run<br>software, which controls the flow of information between inputs and outputs and<br>the reading and writing of information to the computer’s memory. Cognitivists<br>aim to investigate psychological ‘software’ – the mind – independently of the<br>‘hardware’ – the brain.

Although many<br>psychologists still think of the mind in terms of information processing,<br>advances in neuroscience have resulted in the investigation of the mind (the<br>‘software’) being combined with the investigation of the brain (the ‘hardware’) –<br>a branch of psychology known as cognitive neuroscience.

However, it’s best not to try to repair it with a<br>wrench.<br>EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY<br>the 30-second theory<br>The human body evolved according to natural selection, and has many things<br>in common with the bodies of other animals. Evolutionary psychology extends<br>this logic to the human mind. Like behaviourism, the focus of evolutionary<br>psychology is to find common principles in the behaviour of humans and<br>animals. Evolutionary biologists have shown how animals have evolved<br>strategies to deal with core activities such as food finding, parenting, conflict<br>resolution and mate selection. Interesting work in evolutionary psychology<br>shows how these activities are influenced by evolutionary necessity even when<br>carried out by supposedly rational humans. There are two versions of<br>evolutionary psychology. A broad version of the theory includes everybody who<br>thinks about psychology from an evolutionary perspective, including<br>anthropologists, biologists interested in behaviour, primatologists and<br>psychologists in many areas. The second, more narrow, version – sometimes<br>distinguished by capital letters (‘Evolutionary Psychology’ or ‘EP’) – focuses on<br>applying ideas from evolutionary theory to human reasoning and social<br>behaviour, and particularly to human sexual behaviour.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Evolution shaped your mind to pass on your genes to your offspring.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Critics accuse evolutionary psychologists of telling ‘just-so stories’ about<br>behaviour – plausible tales that capture the imagination but which cannot be<br>proved true or false. Worse, critics claim some people use evolutionary<br>arguments to justify unfair or implausible theories about how society should be<br>organized. Despite this, most psychologists would agree that psychology is part<br>of biology, and so must be understood within the framework of evolution – they<br>just disagree about the extent to which evolution is directly relevant to human<br>behaviour.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>EKMAN’S UNIVERSAL EMOTIONS<br>CHOMKSY’S UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>DAVID BUSS<br>1953–<br>LEDA COSMIDES<br>1957–<br>CHARLES DARWIN<br>1809–1882<br>STEVEN PINKER<br>1954–<br>JOHN TOOBY<br>1954–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Tom Stafford<br>Chimps, like humans, form groups, laugh, recognize themselves in the mirror,<br>and use tools, suggesting that we have a shared evolutionary heritage.<br>POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY<br>the 30-second theory<br>‘That that don’t kill me can only make me stronger.’ So sang rapper Kanye<br>West in his 2007 track ‘Stronger’. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher,<br>put it similarly in the nineteenth century when he wrote, ‘What doesn’t kill us<br>makes us stronger.’ Their words would make an ideal motto for positive<br>psychology – a movement that was launched by University of Pennsylvania<br>psychologist Martin Seligman in his presidential address to the American<br>Psychological Association’s annual convention in 1998. Seligman lamented the<br>fact that psychology had for so long focused on mental ailments and distress. He<br>called on the discipline to focus more on the positive – on people’s strengths and<br>virtues. Today the sub-discipline of positive psychology has its own journal,<br>international organization and regular conferences. Research in positive<br>psychology has uncovered tentative evidence that people’s characters can be<br>strengthened by adverse experiences, such as surviving a disaster or living with<br>an illness. In the realm of work, productivity has been shown to rise when<br>managers focus on their employees’ strengths; in the context of therapy,<br>researchers have found that it helps if therapists spend time considering their<br>clients’ strengths, not just their problems.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Psychology should spend less time focusing on people’s mental distress and<br>more time understanding and nurturing their strengths and virtues.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Not everyone is enamoured of the positivity message. In 2009, the writer and<br>activist Barbara Ehrenreich published a book entitled: Bright-sided: How the<br>Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America.

<p>GROWTH &amp; CHANGE<br>GROWTH &amp; CHANGE<br>GLOSSARY<br>behaviourist Someone who subscribes to behaviourism, a school of thought that<br>believes psychology should concern itself only with visible, and therefore<br>verifiable, behaviour, rather than invisible, and therefore unverifiable, thought<br>processes. This approach contends that behaviour is mainly influenced by<br>environmental stimuli.<br>egocentric The inability to see a situation from someone else’s perspective.<br>According to Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, this takes place during<br>the pre-operational stage, between two and six. He devised the ‘three mountains’<br>task’, in which a child is asked to draw model mountains from the point of view<br>of a movable doll, to show that children cannot imagine what things look like<br>from other people’s perspective.<br>environmental factors Most psychologists nowadays believe that people’s<br>development is shaped by a combination of genetic and environmental factors<br>(the nature/nurture argument). Chief among the environmental factors are:<br>family background, diet, exposure to disease, educational opportunities and<br>social milieu. All can have a significant impact on a child’s development,<br>although it is also clear that someone brought up in an imperfect environment<br>can develop normally and lead a happy and fulfilling life.<br>epistemology The study of the theoretical foundations of knowledge. It is<br>mainly concerned with finding out what knowledge is and how it is acquired,<br>and exploring how it relates to major life issues, such as the concept of truth.<br>hypothetical Assumed or theoretical, not proven. A hypothetical scenario is one<br>that assumes certain unproven factors, which may (or may not) be proven correct<br>through scientific observation. Most scientific theories start off as hypotheses<br>that are over time proven true.<br>internalization In developmental psychology, the way a child acquires<br>knowledge through social interaction with another person (usually a parent).<br>First the child experiences a situation with another person, then re-experiences<br>the situation within him/herself, until it becomes part of the child’s body of<br>knowledge. This process is thought to apply to functions such as language,<br>memory and abstract thought.<br>methodology A set of theories, rules and procedures applied to a particular field<br>of study or other endeavour. What is appropriate in one discipline may not be in<br>another.<br>moral development The process through which children learn the difference<br>between right and wrong. Jean Piaget believed that children initially judge good<br>and bad by the consequences of people’s actions (such as, did anyone get hurt?<br>Was anything broken?), which then changes to a consideration of people’s<br>intentions (e.g. did they mean to hurt someone/break something?). Kohlberg<br>went further and divided moral development into six stages, the highest of which<br>only 10 per cent of adults achieve.<br>neuroscience The study of the nervous system, including the brain functions and<br>how they relate to human behaviour. Ultimately the task of neuroscientists is to<br>discover the functions of all parts of the brain, what mental processes they<br>perform and how they are affected by external stimuli. Once a branch of biology,<br>it is now regarded as an interdisciplinary science which covers several other<br>disciplines, such as psychology, medicine and computer science.<br>psychoanalyst Someone who treats emotional disorders using the techniques of<br>psychoanalytic theory that were developed by Sigmund Freud in the 1890s.<br>Training involves four years’ study, during which time the students themselves<br>are obliged to undergo analysis.<br>schema A preconceived block of knowledge that helps us cope with unknown<br>aspects of the world. At its best, it means we don’t have to learn everything from<br>scratch, such as how to drive a vehicle; we simply apply our ‘driving schema’ to<br>any vehicle. At its worst, it means we presume knowledge we don’t have and<br>make prejudiced judgments, such as not stopping in the street to talk to people<br>because we assume they are begging.<br>stereotypical Characterized by stereotypes; a way of thinking which involves<br>stereotypes. Stereotypes are generalizations that are applied to a group of people<br>without any consideration of individual variations. Thus, the idea that Jewish<br>people are only interested in making money is a stereotypical view that doesn’t<br>allow for the fact that many Jewish people couldn’t care less about making<br>money.<br>surrogate A person or thing that acts as a substitute for someone or something<br>else. The term is often applied to a woman or man who takes the place of a<br>child’s mother or father.<br>PIAGET’S STAGES<br>the 30-second theory<br>As an epistemologist (someone who studies the nature of knowledge), Piaget<br>was interested in how knowledge develops in humans, and regarded intelligence<br>as the means by which we adapt to the environment. He believed that a child’s<br>understanding of reality is constructed through continuous interaction with the<br>world, and that knowledge is organized into schemas – the basic building blocks<br>of intelligent behaviour – which become increasingly complex as the child<br>grows. Piaget suggested that knowledge develops in stages. In the sensori-motor<br>stage (0–2 years), the child ‘thinks’ by perceiving objects and acting upon them.<br>Towards the end of this stage, the child will search for hidden objects – ‘out of<br>sight’ is no longer ‘out of mind’. The pre-operational stage (2–7 years) is<br>defined largely by the development and use of mental images, symbols and<br>language. The child is egocentric, or self-centred, and cannot understand that<br>others might see things differently. During the concrete operational stage (7–11<br>years), the child becomes less self-centred and can think logically, but still needs<br>to manipulate objects in order to do so. The formal operational stage (11–15<br>years) is marked by the ability to manipulate ideas and to think hypothetically<br>about situations not yet experienced.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Children are little scientists constructing their own understanding of the world,<br>and their mistakes are the best indicators of how they think.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Piaget was hugely influential, but his ideas have been heavily criticized. One<br>major criticism is that he ignored the role of social factors in the development of<br>knowledge. Another is that he did not use standardized methods – he started by<br>asking children the same set of questions, but then tailored later questions<br>according to the answers they gave. Furthermore, he did not use statistics to<br>analyze his results, and did not account for individual differences.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>VYGOTSKY’S ZONE<br>KOHLBERG’S MORAL STAGES<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>JEAN PIAGET<br>1896–1980<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>Piaget believed that the child’s mind develops, brick by brick, through discrete<br>stages.<br>VYGOTSKY’S ZONE<br>the 30-second theory<br>For Vygotsky, our ability to think and reason is largely the product of a social<br>process. Young children can do very little by or for themselves, and learn instead<br>by interacting with others. By taking part in social activities with ‘expert’ tutors<br>or instructors, such as parents and teachers, they move towards independence<br>and self-sufficiency. This involves a gradual transformation of their intellectual<br>abilities: the problem-solving process initially takes place within the social<br>setting, but becomes ‘internalized’ as the child follows by example. Consider<br>pointing – at first, it is little more than an indicatory gesture, the baby’s failed<br>attempt at grasping something beyond her reach. When the mother sees her baby<br>pointing, she helps out, and may point to the object herself. As a result, the baby<br>learns to point to an object out of her reach, then gazes at her mother. The<br>pointing gesture is intended as a signal to the mother that she wants the object<br>she is pointing to. Vygotsky’s ‘zone of proximal development’ refers to the gap<br>between the child’s actual and potential development, or what she has already<br>mastered and what she can do under the guidance of an adult. Accordingly, IQ<br>tests cannot provide a measure of the child’s true capabilities, because they only<br>indicate what she can do unassisted.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Children are young apprentices, acquiring knowledge and new skills through<br>guided collaboration with those who already possess them.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Despite dying at the age of 37, Vygotsky made a significant contribution to<br>psychology, and his ideas are particularly relevant to education. As well as<br>questioning the validity of standardized testing, he showed how teachers can<br>support pupils’ intellectual development by means of interactions and<br>instructions structured around the tasks they can perform independently. In so<br>doing, the teacher provides a ‘scaffold’, or context, within which the pupil can<br>exercise her existing knowledge to solve the problem at hand.<br>exercise her existing knowledge to solve the problem at hand.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>PIAGET’S STAGES<br>KOHLBERG’S MORAL STAGES<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>LEV VYGOTSKY<br>1896–1934<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>Vygotsky pointed out that children don’t learn in a social vacuum, but by<br>interacting with, and observing, others.<br>BIRTH ORDER<br>the 30-second theory<br>The idea that birth order can have a lasting influence on personality and<br>behaviour was first suggested by the influential psychologist Alfred Adler in the<br>1930s. Adler argued that the eldest child is socially dominant and intellectual,<br>but tends to seek approval from others because he is no longer the centre of<br>attention following the birth of a sibling; that the middle child, being sandwiched<br>between older and younger siblings, is competitive and diplomatic; and that the<br>youngest child tends to be selfish and demanding, since he is used to being<br>provided for. Adler also stated, however, that although birth order is a<br>contributory factor, it is environmental conditions, such as socioeconomic<br>circumstances, that ultimately shape personality. There is no doubt that parents<br>treat their first and second siblings differently – they can devote more time,<br>attention and resources to, and tend to be more protective of, their first child.<br>With the birth of a sibling, the firstborn loses his status as the only child, and the<br>parents divide their time between the two. This differential treatment could<br>plausibly affect the children’s personalities, but it is impossible to establish<br>exactly how, because its effects cannot be isolated from those of other factors<br>such as sex, the age gap between siblings and socioeconomic status.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>A person’s rank by age among their siblings affects their psychological<br>development and personality.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Although the idea that birth order affects personality is very popular, it has<br>proved to be highly controversial, because there is very little scientific evidence<br>to support it. Many of the studies investigating birth order effects do not take the<br>confounding variables into account. Recent research lends some credence to the<br>idea, however, with one 2009 study showing that lower birth rank has a negative,<br>albeit small, effect on IQ.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>PIAGET’S STAGES<br>KOHLBERG’S MORAL STAGES<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>ALFRED ADLER<br>1870–1937<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>If you’re the first born, you get your parents’ undivided attention – but<br>remember, they’ve never done this before!<br>HARLOW’S MONKEYS<br>the 30-second theory<br>Harry Harlow was interested in the formation of the bond between mother<br>and child, and tried to assess the relative importance of the child’s need for food<br>and its need for comfort. In a set of famous, but unethical, experiments, he<br>separated newborn rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers and raised<br>them in cages with ‘surrogate’ mothers. The infant monkeys were made to<br>choose between two different surrogates – one was made of wire and had a<br>bottle of milk attached to it, while the other was made of soft and cuddly<br>towelling but did not have a bottle. Harlow found that the infants spent most of<br>their time clinging to the cloth mother, even though ‘she’ provided no<br>nourishment. In another experiment, he placed the infants into cages containing<br>only one of the two surrogates. Those caged in with a cloth mother felt secure<br>enough to explore their new environment, and would run back and cling to ‘her’<br>when frightened by a loud noise. By contrast, the infants placed with the wire<br>surrogate did not explore their cage and, when frightened, would either freeze<br>and cower, or run around the cage aimlessly.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Newborn monkeys need warmth, contact and comfort at least as much as they<br>need food and water, and this probably applies to human infants, too.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Harlow showed that baby monkeys have an unlearned need for contact comfort<br>that is as basic as the need for food. By doing so, he challenged the ‘cupboard<br>love’ attachment theories popular with behaviourists and psychoanalysts, which<br>stated that the infant bonds with its mother because she can satisfy its instinctive<br>need for nourishment. He also argued that fathers can make equally good caregivers as mothers, a revolutionary idea at the time.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WATSON’S BEHAVIOURISM<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>HARRY HARLOW<br>1905–1981<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>Harlow’s research into infant monkeys found that babies don’t cuddle mothers<br>as a bribe for milk, they really do like the affection.<br>KOHLBERG’S MORAL STAGES<br>the 30-second theory<br>Lawrence Kohlberg studied moral development by presenting children with<br>moral dilemmas involving a conflict between two or more moral principles. He<br>classified his participants according to their level of moral development on the<br>basis of the reasoning behind the answers they gave. Kohlberg identified three<br>levels of moral development, each consisting of two stages. At stage 1, the<br>child’s sense of what is right and wrong is determined by what is punishable and<br>what is not, and at stage 2 by what others want and what brings reward. At stage<br>3, good behaviour is characterized by whatever pleases and helps others, and at<br>stage 4 by showing respect for authority. At stage 5, children understand that,<br>although rules should normally be followed, they are sometimes superseded by<br>the rights of the individual. At stage 6, the highest level, actions are determined<br>by self-chosen ethical principles – such as justice, equality and respect for<br>human dignity – which are established through reflection. These principles are<br>abstract and universal, and full moral responsibility can only be attained by<br>acting in accordance with them. Kohlberg believed that only about 10 per cent of<br>adults reach this level of moral reasoning, and later concluded that stage 6 may<br>not be a separate stage after all.<br>30-SECOND PSYCHE<br>A child’s sense of morality develops in a stereotypical way and is based on the<br>fundamental principle of justice.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Kohlberg found that the answers given by children of different nationalities and<br>ages are reasonably consistent with regard to his stages of moral development.<br>Some psychologists have argued that most children are unfamiliar with the<br>moral dilemmas used, and might provide more mature answers to problems that<br>are more relevant to them. Others point out that the emphasis on justice makes<br>Kohlberg’s theory inherently sexist, because qualities that traditionally define<br>female ‘goodness’, such as caring for others, are lower on his scale.<br>female ‘goodness’, such as caring for others, are lower on his scale.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>PIAGET’S STAGES<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>LAWRENCE KOHLBERG<br>1927–1987<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>‘Dad, it’s not fair that you’re telling me off for bad behaviour now – I’ve only<br>reached Kohlberg’s fifth stage of morality’.<br>NEUROPLASTICITY<br>the 30-second theory<br>Plastic means flexible. Neuroplasticity is the collection of ways in which the<br>brain changes in response to what we do and experience. If you believe the mind<br>is the activity of the brain, then every change in your mind must, logically, entail<br>changes in your brain. Considered this way, evidence of neuroplasticity should<br>be expected. What really surprises neuroscientists is the extent to which the<br>brain can change in response to injuries or new challenges. Supposedly ‘visual’<br>areas of the brain are recruited by the sense of touch in the blind, or – as<br>demonstrated by Alvaro Pascual-Leone – even in sighted people who live with a<br>blindfold on for five days. This reorganization according to a person’s activities<br>(such as seeing or touching) seems to be a general principle of brain<br>development. This principle operates throughout the lifetime, not just in<br>childhood. So, to take a famous example, a part of the brain involved in<br>navigation has been shown to be larger in London cab drivers, who spend their<br>adult lives finding their way around the city. The concept of neuroplasticity is<br>tied to the idea that we can change how we think, and our abilities, throughout<br>our lifetime and that keeping mentally active can help us to remain flexible and<br>alert in older age.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>What you do and think can change the structure of your brain.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>One reason neuroplasticity is currently much discussed is that it contradicts the<br>idea that the mind is a static, computer-like, information-processing machine.<br>Another might be that people find it surprising because, even though it is<br>orthodoxy that the mind is based on the brain, we still don’t, in our hearts,<br>believe that all our thoughts and feelings are due to a lump of meat between our<br>ears.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>PAVLOV’S DOGS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>ALVARO PASCUAL-LEONE<br>1961–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Tom Stafford<br>Brains can be flexible – research into blind people has shown that their other<br>senses often commandeer the redundant visual parts of their brains.</p>

Psychological impulses range from altruism to outright<br>self-sabotage.<br>cold state In an unaroused condition, as opposed to ‘hot state’, which is when<br>our appetites are aroused. The term has its origins in the so-called hot-cold<br>empathy gaps described by US psychologist George Loewenstein and developed<br>by Loran Nordgren and others. Loewenstein found that people in an unaroused<br>(‘cold’) state failed to anticipate their behaviour when aroused (or ‘hot’).

Treatment includes referral to a<br>physiotherapist, prescribing drugs and/or surgery.<br>physiological Relating to the normal functioning of a body. A physiological<br>reaction is a response usually triggered by the brain. There is ongoing debate<br>about what stage the conscious brain engages, and whether emotions trigger the<br>reaction or vice versa. The classic example given in the James–Lange theory of<br>emotion is that of a person coming across a bear in the woods. Their<br>physiological reaction is to tremble and then run.

Ekman argues that muscle movements<br>in the face are the building blocks of facial expressions, and that the relationship<br>between these movements and emotions is universal. He showed photos of faces<br>expressing various emotions to people from different parts of the world,<br>including North and South America, Japan, and the Fore peoples of the Papua<br>New Guinea highlands, and found that they all identified the same faces with the<br>same emotional words. He also filmed the facial expressions of US and Japanese<br>students as they watched movies, and observed the same expressions in both. He<br>took these results as evidence that the expression of emotions is constant across<br>cultures, and suggested that this apparent universality is due to evolution, innate<br>brain mechanisms or common developmental processes. Ekman used his<br>findings to devise the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a comprehensive<br>index of facial expressions.

In the absence of any external justification for the anomalous<br>behaviour, the contradiction is resolved by altering your original belief. The<br>American psychologist Leon Festinger showed this with James Carlsmith in a<br>classic study in 1959, known as ‘the boring task’. Having performed an hourlong monotonous task involving pegs on a board, students were paid either one<br>dollar or twenty dollars to convince another person that the task was fun and<br>interesting. Afterwards, the students were asked by a researcher what they really<br>thought of the boring task: those paid just one dollar said that they had found the<br>task enjoyable whereas the students paid twenty dollars said that it was in truth<br>terribly dull. Festinger’s interpretation was that the students’ belief that the task<br>was dull clashed with the fact that they’d just told someone else it was fun, thus<br>causing uncomfortable ‘cognitive dissonance’. For the students who had been<br>paid twenty dollars, this contradiction was easily resolved – they’d been paid a<br>fair sum and that’s why they’d lied. For the students who had been paid just one<br>dollar, however, the contradiction was more easily resolved by altering their<br>original belief.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Whenever a pair of incompatible beliefs or decisions collide in our minds, it<br>provokes a kind of mental discomfort known as ‘cognitive dissonance’.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>It’s not just us humans who experience cognitive dissonance – monkeys do, too.<br>Louisa Egan and her colleagues at Yale University showed this in a 2007 study<br>in which they offered capuchin monkeys the choice between pairs of differently<br>coloured, yet equally appealing sweets.

You rip open the envelope,<br>scan the text and there it is, the crucial line announcing you’ve got the job. Joy<br>rises up causing a huge smile to spread across your face. Wait a minute.<br>According to the James–Lange theory of emotion – proposed independently by<br>the great US psychologist William James and the Danish physiologist Carl<br>Lange – this description has it back to front. James and Lange argued that a<br>stimulus, in this case the good news, triggers a physiological reaction, such as a<br>racing heartbeat and the spread of a smile, and it is these bodily and facial<br>changes that cause the emotion, in this case joy. Writing in the late nineteenth<br>century James gave the example of a confrontation with a bear. We don’t<br>become frightened, tremble and then run, he argued. Rather, we tremble and run,<br>and it’s those bodily changes that cause us to feel frightened. The James–Lange<br>theory was challenged in the early twentieth century by the physiologist Walter<br>Cannon. He conducted grisly experiments showing that dogs still exhibited<br>emotions even after he’d severed their spinal cords thereby preventing bodily<br>feedback from reaching their brains.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Emotions don’t cause bodily changes, rather bodily changes cause emotions.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The James–Lange theory has received support in recent years from research<br>showing that the mere act of smiling can lead people to feel happier. What’s<br>more, a 2008 study of women who had undergone cosmetic botox treatment<br>found that they experienced less activity than usual in the emotional centres of<br>their brain when they pulled an angry expression.

And who knows, maybe the bear will smile back.<br>DAMASIO’S EMOTIONAL DECISION MAKING<br>the 30-second theory<br>In the late 1970s, American neurologist Antonio Damasio noticed something<br>peculiar in several of his patients. When certain parts of their brains were<br>damaged, people with otherwise normal brain function found it difficult to make<br>decisions. For example, one of his patients spent half an hour deliberating on the<br>best time for his next appointment, until Damasio finally just told him when to<br>show up. Subsequent experiments convinced Damasio that the damaged areas in<br>these patients’ brains were responsible for connecting emotions with knowledge<br>and logic. Since emotions are generally experienced somatically (physically), he<br>called his explanation of decision making the somatic marker hypothesis. When<br>patients with damaged prefrontal cortices were shown emotional images, such as<br>mutilated bodies or people having sex, their heart rate and other vital signs did<br>not increase, as they do in people with undamaged brains. Similarly, these<br>patients could not master a simple gambling game, losing all their money when<br>normal people saw how to profit from it. The somatic marker hypothesis says the<br>prefrontal cortex stores knowledge about emotions – such as the negative<br>feelings associated with losing money – that helps us to make good decisions.<br>Good decisions aren’t just logical, they’re emotional, too.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Do you make decisions using cool logic or hot emotions? Probably both.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The specific brain area associated with the somatic marker hypothesis is the<br>ventromedial prefrontal cortex, just behind and above your eyes. Aside from<br>observing the impairments in his patients, Damasio reasoned that it makes sense<br>for this region to be involved in decision making. It not only receives inputs<br>from all our senses, but also connects with emotional centres of the brain in the<br>hippocampus and amygdala – and it’s a part of the frontal lobe, where reasoning<br>occurs.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY<br>EKMAN’S UNIVERSAL EMOTIONS<br>KAHNEMAN &amp; TVERSKY’S PROSPECT THEORY<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>ANTOINE BECHARA<br>1961–<br>ANTONIO DAMASIO<br>1944–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Dave Munger<br>Try to make a cool, calm, considered decision, and it might be a poorer one<br>than if you’d allowed your emotions to kick in.<br>WASON’S CONFIRMATION BIAS<br>the 30-second theory<br>Back in the 1960s, the British psychologist Peter Wason presented research<br>participants with four cards, each with a letter on one side and a number on the<br>other. Two of them showed a letter on their upper face, the other two showed a<br>number, rather like this: B, E, 4, 8. The participants’ task was to say which cards<br>they’d need to turn over to test the statement: ‘If a card has a “B” on one side, it<br>always has a “4” on the other.’ Most participants said they’d turn over the ‘B’<br>card, which is fair enough—anything other than a ‘4’ on the other side would<br>refute the statement. However, the majority of participants then mistakenly said<br>they’d turn over the ‘4’. Doing so is pointless. The presence of a ‘B’ on the other<br>side would support the statement, but not conclusively. The presence of any<br>other letter would have no bearing on the statement. The other card the<br>participants should have opted to turn over is the ‘8’. If this revealed a ‘B’, the<br>statement would be falsified. Known as the ‘Wason selection task’, this and<br>other research Wason conducted showed our strong ‘confirmation bias’ – the<br>tendency to seek out evidence that supports our existing beliefs.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>We seek out and pay particular attention to information that supports our<br>existing beliefs.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>We read newspapers that espouse our own political views and pay more<br>attention to adverts that champion our favourite brands. What happens when<br>we’re confronted with scientific evidence that directly contradicts our personal<br>beliefs? A 2010 study by Towson University psychologist Geoffrey Munro<br>found that such a situation leads many of us to conclude that the topic at hand,<br>and other topics, too, are not amenable to scientific inquiry – what he called ‘the<br>scientific impotence excuse’.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>FESTINGER’S BORING TASK<br>JANIS’ GROUPTHINK<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>PETER WASON<br>1924–2003<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>From voting to shopping, to improve your decision making try considering the<br>reasons against, as well as the reasons for, your current favourite.<br>BAUMEISTER’S EGO DEPLETION<br>the 30-second theory<br>All fresh and crumbly, a biscuit sits on a plate under your nose. Can you<br>resist it? It depends on what you’ve been up to earlier in the day. Research<br>conducted over the last two decades by US psychologist Roy Baumeister has<br>shown that willpower is a finite resource – straining to control yourself in one<br>situation will leave you easily swayed later on. For example, in one classic study<br>Baumeister instructed participants to sit in a room on their own, to resist the<br>plate of chocolate biscuits and instead eat two or three of the radishes that were<br>also available. Afterwards these abstemious participants gave up far earlier on an<br>impossible puzzle than did other students who had been allowed to eat the<br>biscuits. Bizarrely, a recent study showed that we can become ‘ego-depleted’ –<br>Baumeister’s term for when we’re willpower-fatigued – merely by imagining the<br>turmoil of another person forced to exercise self-restraint. The good news is<br>there’s evidence that, rather like a muscle, it’s possible to build up our willpower<br>through practice. Resist that biscuit today and, who knows, maybe it will be<br>easier tomorrow.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Like the fuel in your car, willpower is a finite resource – using it up in one<br>situation will leave you vulnerable to temptation in another.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>According to Northwestern University psychologist Loran Nordgren and his<br>collaborators, one of the reasons we often leave ourselves open to temptation is<br>that when we’re satiated – what they call a cold state – we underestimate the<br>strength of our desires when we’re in a hot state (hungry, tired or lustful). They<br>call this the ‘restraint’ bias.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>FESTINGER’S BORING TASK<br>KAHNEMAN &amp; TVERSKY’S PROSPECT THEORY<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>ROY BAUMEISTER<br>1953–<br>3-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>If you’ve just eaten, you might be able to resist those chocolate biscuits, but<br>don’t underestimate their appeal once you’re hungry again.<br>KAHNEMAN &amp; TVERSKY’S PROSPECT<br>THEORY<br>the 30-second theory<br>There is a rational way to do calculations that involve risks. If you have a<br>choice between a 100 per cent chance of losing $15 and a 5 per cent chance of<br>losing $400, you could multiply 15 by 1.00 and 400 by 0.05 and select the<br>choice with the lowest result. This is known as calculating ‘expected utility’.<br>However, you probably don’t use this method – when asked to make choices<br>involving risks you probably use intuition. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky<br>developed prospect theory to describe such intuitions. A key aspect of their<br>theory is that we think about risks of losing differently from the way we consider<br>risks of winning. In the example above, the second choice has the lower<br>expected utility ($400 x 0.05 = $20, in other words an ‘expected’ loss of $20,<br>compared with $15 in the first choice) – but many people feel intuitively that<br>they would prefer the second choice. Prospect theory describes this as being<br>‘risk seeking for losses’. You will gamble on a big loss to avoid a dead cert<br>small loss. The reverse is where you prefer a small certain gain to a gamble over<br>a potentially much larger gain. Prospect theory describes this as being ‘risk<br>averse for gains’.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Our calculations involving risk are biased depending on whether we stand to<br>gain or lose.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Prospect theory was part of the work that won Daniel Kahneman a Nobel Prize<br>in Economics, and is foundational to the area known as ‘behavioural<br>economics’, which seeks to uncover descriptions of the way we actually behave<br>in defiance of supposedly rational behaviour. Because any gamble can result in a<br>loss or a gain depending on what you assume the status quo is, an important<br>consequence of prospect theory is that you can change how people feel about a<br>bet by changing whether you describe it as a chance of a loss or a gain.<br>bet by changing whether you describe it as a chance of a loss or a gain.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION<br>DAMASIO’S EMOTIONAL DECISION MAKING<br>WASON’S CONFIRMATION BIAS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>DANIEL KAHNEMAN<br>1934–<br>AMOS TVERSKY<br>1937–1996<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Tom Stafford<br>Losses pack about twice the emotional punch of gains of the same size.</p>

<p>SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY<br>SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY<br>GLOSSARY<br>dehumanize A process whereby a person or a group of people is regarded as<br>subhuman and therefore not deserving of the same rights accorded to other<br>people. The process is usually triggered by a difference in skin colour, religion<br>or intelligence. The classic example is the treatment of Jews by the Nazis, but<br>more recent examples include the relationship between Tutsis and Hutus in<br>Rwanda and between the Serbs and other groups in the former Yugoslavia.<br>group polarization The tendency of a group of like-minded people to adopt<br>views that are more extreme than they would be expected to adopt as<br>individuals. This happens when the group is highly energized, dissent is<br>suppressed, and events appear to take on a life of their own. The result of this<br>group dynamic can affect the decision of juries and lead to extreme action, such<br>as mob lynchings.<br>hypothesis A theoretical explanation of a phenomenon, often predicting the<br>outcome given a certain set of circumstances. Most scientific theories start off as<br>hypotheses and, once they are proved, become theories.<br>individuality The sum of the characteristics of a person or thing that<br>distinguishes them from others in the same group. Societies can be characterized<br>as individualistic or collective, with most Western countries placing greater<br>emphasis on individuality, while Asian countries encourage collectivism.<br>intergroup Taking place between two or more social groups. Intergroup<br>relations play an important part in understanding social conflict, such as in<br>black-Latino neighbourhoods in the United States. How people behave within a<br>group can differ significantly from how they behave as individuals outside the<br>group.<br>outgroup A group which is not part of one’s own social grouping. An ingroup is<br>a group of which one is either a member, or of which one aspires to be a<br>member. All other groups are outgroups and are usually regarded with varying<br>degrees of disdain or suspicion. The concept comes from social identity theory,<br>which was developed by the sociologist Henri Tajfel and others in the 1970s to<br>explain the origins of racial prejudice.<br>pathological Literally, something relating to pathology, or the study of disease.<br>In psychology, it refers to behaviour caused by or indicating mental illness.<br>Colloquially, it usually refers to behaviour that is considered excessive or well<br>beyond the norm.<br>personality profile Summary of a person’s personality usually conducted<br>through some form of psychological testing. The results are matched to certain<br>established types that are intended to predict a person’s behaviour.<br>prototypical Relating to a prototype, or something that is most representative of<br>a certain category. Thus, a hammer might be a prototypical tool. Other objects<br>within that category can then be arranged according to their relationship to the<br>prototype, for example, a screwdriver is smaller and lighter.<br>schizophrenia A psychiatric diagnosis associated with abnormalities in several<br>of the brain’s neurotransmitters. Typically, the condition is marked by a<br>distorted view of reality, an inability to function socially, withdrawal from<br>society, hearing voices and delusions of grandeur. Sub-categories include:<br>paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated and residual schizophrenia.<br>self-esteem How people regard themselves. Someone with good self-esteem has<br>a high sense of their own worth, whereas someone with poor self-esteem has a<br>low sense of their own worth. Self-esteem has powerful impact on a person’s<br>behaviour.<br>social identity The ways in which a person categorizes themselves and others.<br>There are four main strands: self-identity (a person’s religious belief, their job),<br>group identity (following a football team, joining a political party), comparison<br>(comparing themselves with other groups), and psychological distinctiveness<br>(their personal characteristics). A combination of these form a person’s social<br>identity. The theory was developed by Henri Tajfel in the 1970s.<br>systemic Being part of a larger system, rather than an isolated occurrence.<br>Systemic psychology considers that people develop partly through their<br>individual consciousness and partly through communication with others, giving<br>them contact with the wider ‘system’. The theory is an offshoot of systems<br>theory and was developed by Gregory Bateson in the 1970s.<br>THE BYSTANDER EFFECT<br>the 30-second theory<br>In the Kew Gardens district of New York in March 1964, bar manager Kitty<br>Genovese was stabbed to death. Her demise was reportedly witnessed by thirtyeight apartment residents, none of whom did a thing to help. The tragedy caused<br>a moral outcry in the local press and it inspired the psychologists John Darley<br>and Bibb Latané to research a phenomenon that’s come to be known as the<br>‘bystander effect’. In their seminal 1968 paper, Darley and Latané tricked<br>research participants into thinking that another participant in the room was<br>having some kind of seizure. The key finding was that participants who thought<br>they were on their own in the room with the ‘victim’ were far more likely to seek<br>help, and to do so more quickly, than were participants seated in the room with<br>three or four others. One explanation for the phenomenon is that the presence of<br>other people reduces our own sense of responsibility for a situation.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The more people present at a given situation, the less likely we are to intervene<br>when someone is in need of help.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>When historian Joseph de May analyzed proceedings from the trial of Winston<br>Moseley – Kitty Genovese’s murderer – he found the story that thirty-eight<br>witnesses did nothing was little more than a myth based on inaccurate newspaper<br>reports of the time.

The mistaken reasoning was that groups<br>come to decisions that reflect the average position of all group members, thereby<br>diluting extremist views. A groundbreaking study by James Stoner in 1961,<br>since replicated hundreds of times, showed that in fact groups make more<br>polarized decisions than individuals. Whether it be in relation to financial risktaking or political attitudes, group discussion accentuates any initial bias held by<br>group members. In the early 1970s, Yale University psychologist Irving Janis<br>argued that certain conditions can lead to a particularly extreme form of group<br>polarization called ‘groupthink’, in which a dangerous illusion of consensus<br>takes over. The preconditions for groupthink include members being close-knit<br>and like-minded, a group leader who makes his or her own position known, and<br>the group being shut off from other influences and opinions. Janis argued that<br>groupthink was responsible for the catastrophic decision making that led to the<br>Bay of Pigs Invasion and the United States’ failure to anticipate Japan’s attack<br>on Pearl Harbor.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Groups of like-minded individuals shut off from outside influence can end up<br>ignoring dissent and making some truly disastrous decisions.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Since Janis’ seminal work, groupthink has been blamed for multiple<br>catastrophes, including the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster and, more recently,<br>the intelligence community’s mistaken belief, prior to the Iraq War, that Saddam<br>Hussein had stockpiles of Weapons of Mass Destruction. ‘Groupthink caused the<br>[intelligence] community to interpret ambiguous evidence such as the<br>procurement of dual use technology, as conclusive evidence,’ Pat Roberts, then<br>Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the press in 2004.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WASON’S CONFIRMATION BIAS<br>THE BYSTANDER EFFECT<br>FOLLOW THE LEADER<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>IRVING JANIS<br>1918–1990<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>History shows that groups are capable of making terrible decisions, especially<br>when they are cut off from dissenting opinions.<br>ALLPORT’S CONTACT HYPOTHESIS<br>the 30-second theory<br>Prejudice emerges at an early age. Young children show a preference for<br>playing with other children of the same skin colour or with other kids who<br>simply happen to be wearing similar clothes. In adulthood, in extreme cases, this<br>instinct for prejudice can lead us to dehumanize those we consider to be<br>outsiders. The antidote, according to the US psychologist Gordon Allport, is<br>intergroup contact. The idea is that by coming into contact with ‘others’ we<br>discover that they’re human, too. Numerous studies, many of them conducted in<br>known sectarian trouble spots such as Northern Ireland, have confirmed that<br>people who have contact with outgroup members tend to have more positive<br>attitudes towards members of that outgroup. For contact to be beneficial, an<br>outsider must be seen as being representative of the group to which they belong.<br>Contact also needs to be meaningful. When members of different social groups<br>exchange intimacies they come to appreciate how much they have in common.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Contact between members of different social groups – be they religious, ethnic<br>or tribal – helps reduce prejudice and fosters friendly intergroup relations.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>A problem with much research into the contact hypothesis is that it is crosssectional. These kinds of studies can’t prove that contact causes positive<br>attitudes; it’s possible that people with more positive attitudes simply seek out<br>more contact. On a more upbeat note, recent research suggests that ‘extended<br>contact’ – having a friend who has a friend who’s from an outgroup – helps<br>reduce prejudice, as does simply imagining a positive encounter with an<br>outgroup member.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WASON’S CONFIRMATION BIAS<br>JANIS’ GROUPTHINK<br>ZIMBARDO’S PRISON<br>FOLLOW THE LEADER<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>GORDON ALLPORT<br>1897–1967<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>The humanity that we share overwhelms any superficial differences between<br>races or other groups.

The men had volunteered to take part in a psychological study of<br>prison life. Another twelve students out of the seventy-five who volunteered<br>were allocated to play the role of prison guards. The study, known today as the<br>‘Stanford prison experiment’, was scheduled to last two weeks but was<br>abandoned after just six days. Philip Zimbardo, the psychologist in charge, says<br>that he aborted because treatment of the prisoners by the guards had sunk to<br>‘pornographic and degrading abuse’, and also because of a visit by his future<br>wife, Christina Maslach, a young psychologist who expressed horror at what was<br>taking place. Some prisoners were extremely distressed and around a third of the<br>guards were behaving in a sadistic fashion. Prestudy personality profiles of those<br>participants who ended up acting as sadistic guards gave no clues as to what they<br>were capable of – all were judged to be emotionally stable and law-abiding.<br>Zimbardo says the study shows how certain situations and social roles can strip<br>people of their individuality, prompting them to acts of sadism or submission.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>A study of prison dynamics conducted in the early 1970s was abandoned when<br>participants acting as guards began treating the mock prisoners with brutality.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment was the focus of renewed interest in<br>2004 when reports of prisoner abuse by US guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in<br>Iraq first surfaced.

He was inspired by the terrible example of the Holocaust,<br>in which ordinary citizens and soldiers collaborated in the evil schemes of the<br>Nazis. In his experiments, volunteers took part in what they thought was a study<br>of memory, giving electric shocks to a partner whenever he forgot things. In<br>reality no shocks were given and the partner was an actor, who howled and<br>protested as the volunteer delivered what he thought were more and more intense<br>shocks. Would ordinary people deliver shocks of lethal voltage to an innocent<br>man? When a scientist in a white coat stood in the corner of the room and merely<br>reassured the volunteers with phrases such as ‘the experiment requires that you<br>continue’, 65 per cent would deliver what they believed were lethal shocks.<br>Milgram’s study was actually a series of eighteen studies, which tested how<br>different factors affected the likelihood that volunteers would obey an authority<br>figure and deliver lethal shocks.

As one of the<br>girls curls back her arm ready to throw, niggling at her mind is an awareness that<br>the boys in the group think girls can’t throw. Their belief is of course a gross<br>generalization and the girl is anxious that if her throw is weak it will only serve<br>to reinforce the boys’ sexist assumptions. Unfortunately, this anxiety undermines<br>her performance – a self-fulfilling effect known as stereotype threat. The<br>phenomenon of stereotype threat was christened by Claude Steele and Joshua<br>Aronson in 1995 after they discovered that black participants performed worse at<br>an intelligence test when it was described to them as a test of ability, rather than<br>as an investigation of how people generally solve problems. Since then,<br>stereotype threat has been documented in relation to other social contexts<br>including gender and mental illness. For example, female chess players perform<br>more poorly when they think they’re up against a male opponent, and patients<br>with schizophrenia have been found to behave more awkwardly when they think<br>their diagnosis has been revealed to a social partner, even when it hasn’t.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Fearing that if we perform badly, other people will use that as evidence to<br>reinforce their prejudices can cause us anxiety and make a poor performance<br>more likely.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Psychologist Geoff Cohen tested a possible buffer against stereotype threat. He<br>asked black and white 12-year-old students to spend ten minutes, several times a<br>year, writing about something they valued – such as family or music – an<br>exercise known to reduce stress and fear of failure. The minority black pupils, at<br>risk of stereotype threat, showed improved grades two years later whereas the<br>majority white children did not; nor did a control group of both black and white<br>pupils who wrote about their morning routine.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>ALLPORT’S CONTACT HYPOTHESIS<br>FOLLOW THE LEADER<br>FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>JOSHUA ARONSON<br>1961–<br>CLAUDE STEELE<br>1946–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>If you fear that your performance will be used to reinforce stereotypes about<br>your sex, age or race, the situation could unfortunately become self-fulfilling.<br>FOLLOW THE LEADER<br>the 30-second theory<br>One of history’s greatest criminals, Adolf Hitler, was actually voted into<br>power. How? A key theory has its basis in social psychologist Henri Tajfel’s<br>experiences as a prisoner of war in the Second World War. Himself a Jew, Tajfel<br>wanted to explain how an horrific event such as the Holocaust could occur –<br>most of his Polish relatives and friends were murdered, and Tajfel only escaped<br>by concealing his identity. A series of experiments carried out in the 1970s<br>helped Tajfel to recognize that people will show remarkable allegiance to<br>arbitrary groups for seemingly unimportant reasons – shared hair colour, place of<br>birth or even after being randomly assigned to a group by an experimenter. This<br>is social identity theory. These groups need leaders, and US psychologist<br>Michael Hogg in the 1990s found that group members will choose not the ‘bestand-brightest’, but the most average individuals with whom most members<br>could easily identify. Once they’re in power, by necessity leaders become<br>different from their constituents, so they must go to increasing lengths to prove<br>they are like their group. This may be why nationalistic slogans – and even<br>outright racism – are often effective political strategies. By defining their group<br>in exclusive terms, leaders can reinforce their social identity and build power.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The best leaders are bold and charismatic, right?

<p>WAYS WE DIFFER<br>WAYS WE DIFFER<br>GLOSSARY<br>cognitive bias The tendency for people to make false judgments based on<br>erroneous presuppositions. There are many forms of cognitive bias, including<br>projection bias (assuming people think the same way you do) and confirmation<br>bias (ignoring information that does not fit in with your beliefs). Its purpose is to<br>help the brain process information quickly, but it throws the reliability of<br>anecdotal and personal evidence into doubt.<br>cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) A therapeutic approach that focuses on<br>the way in which a patient thinks about and manages problems. The premise of<br>cognitive behavioural therapy is that people have self-destructive tendencies and<br>patterns of behaviour that are self-perpetuating and amplify, rather than solve,<br>problems. Using workbooks to record their reaction to difficulties, patients are<br>taught to recognize these negative patterns and are given positive strategies for<br>dealing with problems.<br>dialectic construct A belief that is arrived at by considering both sides of the<br>argument. Dialectics is the process of pitching an idea (thesis) against its<br>opposite (antithesis) and developing a new idea that combines the two.<br>epigenetics The study of how cells are able to change their appearance and<br>behaviour, despite maintaining the same DNA. It is thought that environmental<br>factors trigger a change in gene expression (how the gene behaves), without<br>requiring any change to its DNA imprint.<br>extraversion One of the big five personality traits (see here). Extraversion is<br>associated with being particularly motivated by potential reward. Extraverts<br>(also spelled extroverts) tend to be outward-going and enjoy the company of<br>others. They look to the outside world for stimulation, rather than looking<br>within. Everyone has aspects of all five personality traits, to varying degrees.<br>idiographic Concerned with specific events or facts, rather than generalities. In<br>psychology, this means focusing on the psychological makeup of the individual<br>person rather than seeking general theories of behaviour.<br>innate An essential part of something or someone, possibly existing since birth.<br>From the Latin innatus, meaning to ‘be born in’.<br>IQ test A measure of intelligence; IQ stands for intelligence quotient. The<br>original test was devised by Alfred Binet in France in the early 1900s and<br>adapted by American psychologist Lewis Terman in 1916. It uses a series of<br>questions to test memory, attention and problem-solving abilities. Originally, the<br>mental age of the subject was divided by their chronological age and multiplied<br>by a hundred to produce the intelligence quotient. Thus, a child of 10 who has a<br>mental age of 12 would score 12/10 x 100 = 120. The modern IQ test is<br>standardized such that an average score is always 100.<br>narcissistic The tendency to be excessively preoccupied with oneself and unable<br>to empathize or care about other people.<br>neuroticism One of the big five personality traits. Neuroticism is associated<br>with a stronger reaction to aversive situations – a struggle to cope with everyday<br>stress – and in extreme cases may lead to depression and anxiety. Everyone has<br>aspects of all five personality traits, to varying degrees.<br>neurotransmitter A chemical that acts as a messenger between neurons and<br>allows impulses to be passed from one cell to the next. Neurotransmitters can<br>either excite or inhibit adjacent cells.<br>personal construct theory The idea that someone’s personality is formed by<br>their understanding of the world around them. By testing different theories to see<br>if they work, we build up a series of ‘constructs’ that define our understanding of<br>the world and create aspects of our personality. The theory was developed by<br>American psychologist George Kelly in the 1950s. He devised a test called the<br>‘repertory grid’ whereby patients are shown three cards, chosen from a set of<br>twenty-one, and asked to choose the odd one out. The results are entered onto a<br>grid to reveal the patients’ personal constructs.<br>personality test A test, usually composed of a series of questions or tasks,<br>designed to evaluate various aspects of the subject’s personality. Many different<br>types of test are available, most of them scored using either a dimensional<br>approach, whereby the results are measured on a scale, or a typological<br>approach, whereby the results are matched to predetermined categories or<br>‘types’.<br>THE LAKE WOBEGON EFFECT<br>the 30-second theory<br>‘Mirror, mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all?’ – the immortal<br>question asked, of course, by the narcissistic Evil Queen from the Snow White<br>fairy tale. Countless psychological studies show that in real life most people<br>have a touch of the Evil Queen’s vanity about them. Across a huge range of<br>measures, from good looks and popularity to driving ability and memory<br>capacity, the typical person believes they are superior to most others. The<br>phenomenon also appears in profession-specific contexts. Stock traders informed<br>about the woeful performance of the average trader continue to believe in their<br>own prognostic powers. Our collective misplaced confidence is thought to<br>explain a number of common human foibles, including seemingly irrational<br>health behaviours, such as smoking (‘It gives other people cancer, but I’ll be<br>okay’) and tardiness – just think how many projects end up late and over-budget.<br>Illusory superiority, as it’s known more formally, was nicknamed the Lake<br>Wobegon effect after the fictional town invented by raconteur Garrison Keillor<br>in which ‘all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the<br>children are above average’.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Across a raft of abilities and qualities the majority of us believe that we’re better<br>than most.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The Lake Wobegon effect has a negative twin known as the ‘worse than<br>average’ effect. This is our negatively skewed belief in our inability to succeed<br>relative to others at particularly unusual or difficult challenges, such as juggling<br>or unicycling.

We<br>quickly deduce that others are friendly, quiet, eccentric and so on. But just how<br>many aspects to a personality are there? The ancient Greeks believed people fall<br>into four temperamental categories – choleric, phlegmatic, sanguine and<br>melancholic. In the middle of the twentieth century, the British-born<br>psychologist Raymond Cattell devised a personality test based on the idea that<br>there are sixteen personality factors including guilt-proneness and shrewdness.<br>Contemporary psychology has now settled on the idea that there are in fact five<br>main factors to personality, known as the big five – extraversion, neuroticism<br>(associated with anxiety and apprehension), conscientiousness, agreeableness<br>and openness (associated with creativity and insight). Each factor encapsulates<br>those aspects of personality that tend always to go together. For example, people<br>who are sociable tend also to be talkative and assertive, as if these three traits are<br>all manifestations of the same underlying factor, in this case extraversion. The<br>big five factors are continuous dimensions like weight or strength. So it’s not the<br>case that we’re either neurotic or we’re not. Rather, we each have a certain<br>amount of neuroticism, and the same holds true for the other factors.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The various permutations of personality are encapsulated by five main factors,<br>known as the big five.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The big five factors are dimensions of personality that we all share. Some<br>psychologists have taken a different (‘idiographic’) approach, documenting each<br>individual’s uniqueness. Best known is George Kelly and his personal construct<br>theory. Kelly proposed that we each see the world in the context of a unique set<br>of dialectic constructs (such as whether people are kind or not) and that by<br>uncovering these constructs, we learn how a person sees the world.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>BIRTH ORDER<br>FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR<br>NATURE VIA NURTURE<br>NOMINATIVE DETERMINISM<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>RAYMOND CATTELL<br>1905–1998<br>GEORGE KELLY<br>1905–1967<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>If you are a high scorer on the neurotic personality dimension, then you might<br>be worried about the risk of those precarious blocks and numbers toppling<br>over.<br>FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR<br>the 30-second theory<br>Attribution is the psychological process of discerning the causes of things.<br>The fundamental attribution error is the tendency to attribute the causes of other<br>people’s behaviour to their intrinsic natures, ignoring constraining<br>circumstances. The phrase was coined by psychologist Lee Ross to describe<br>results which showed that people who were asked to read out a speech on a<br>controversial topic were then judged as holding those opinions, even by people<br>who knew they were reading the speech because the experimenter had asked<br>them to! The flip side of the fundamental attribution error is that we tend to<br>overattribute our own behaviour to external circumstances, rather than to<br>personality characteristics. In other words, ‘I was late because the alarm didn’t<br>go off, but you’re late because you’re careless!’ Or, ‘your views are prejudiced,<br>but mine are reasonable.’ The fundamental attribution error is a classic cognitive<br>bias; a tendency in people’s thinking found in many situations. Critically, people<br>also often fail to account for the effect of this bias on their thinking. The reason<br>for this is the same as the reason why the bias exists in the first place: our own<br>circumstances and intentions are available to us directly and feel compelling.<br>The intentions and circumstances of others are not available to us, so we judge<br>them on their overt behaviours.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>It is easy to think of our own behaviour as caused by events, and the behaviour<br>of others as caused by their personalities.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Although fundamental attribution operates in many different situations, there are<br>differences in how strong it is. Research into individualistic versus collectivist<br>cultures (for example, US vs. Chinese) suggests that the bias is stronger in<br>individualistic ones, where people have a stronger sense of themselves as<br>independent.

This of course is the<br>classic nature/nurture debate, which in modern scientific parlance has become a<br>question of the relative contribution of genes versus the environment. Today it’s<br>recognized that humans are shaped both by their genetic inheritance and by their<br>life’s experiences, often in an interactive fashion. A great example of how genes<br>and the environment can combine to produce a given outcome was provided by a<br>decades-long study of thousands of people in New Zealand. During this study<br>people were tested for the presence of a less active version of a certain gene,<br>MAOA (which is indirectly involved with the release of neurotransmitters, such<br>as serotonin, that control mood and aggression). In those people who had had a<br>non-abusive upbringing, the presence of the less active MAOA gene made no<br>difference to the likelihood of that person having an aggressive personality in<br>adulthood. However, for participants who’d suffered maltreatment in childhood,<br>having the less active MAOA gene made them particularly vulnerable to<br>developing an antisocial personality.

At least that’s what appears to be happening if<br>you compare average performance on intelligence tests today with average<br>scores achieved by previous generations through the twentieth century. The<br>phenomenon has been dubbed ‘the Flynn effect’, after the New Zealand<br>Professor of Political Studies James R. Flynn who first noticed it. The same<br>pattern has been found for the nearly thirty countries for which we have the<br>necessary historical data. How big is the intelligence rise? According to Flynn, if<br>we allocated an IQ score of 100 to the average performance of contemporary<br>American adults (as is the convention), an American adult of average<br>intelligence in the year 1900 would, by today’s standards, achieve a score of<br>between 50 and 70. This is the range normally considered learning disabled! Of<br>course the Victorians weren’t all stupid. Further investigation shows that it’s<br>only on certain subscales that we have improved – especially those that tap our<br>ability to categorize concepts and recognize abstract rules. Flynn believes that<br>it’s the rising ubiquity of science education and visual technologies that have<br>boosted our performance in these specific areas.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Average performance on intelligence tests increased throughout much of the<br>twentieth century.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Data from the end of the twentieth century suggest that the Flynn effect has<br>stopped in some developed nations and may even have started to reverse.

According to influential research by psychologist<br>Anders Ericsson, however, the path to expertise is available to anyone who’s<br>prepared to put in the necessary levels of practice. How much? Studies of elite<br>musicians, athletes and chess players suggest at least 10,000 hours of practice<br>spread over a period of more than ten years. What’s more, not just any kind of<br>practice will do. Ericsson says it needs to be what he calls ‘deliberate practice’,<br>in which you don’t just repeat what you know but instead constantly seek to<br>stretch yourself. This inevitably involves forensic self-criticism, repeated failure<br>and a dogged ability to keep dusting yourself down and trying again – a process<br>that’s not particularly enjoyable and quite distinct from leisurely practice.<br>Although Ericsson’s perspective argues against the idea of innate gifts, his<br>concept of deliberate practice does of course require a rare mix of motivation,<br>good health and opportunity.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Greatness isn’t innate, it comes from epic amounts of self-critical, obsessive<br>practice.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>As well as excessive practice, other situational factors that apparently ease us<br>towards greatness include being born in January (thereby having the advantage<br>of being older than peers in class and on the sports pitch) and being born in a<br>city of fewer than 500,000 citizens – the latter apparently allows for the<br>opportunity to sample many different activities, which builds generic skills, such<br>as self-discipline and coordination.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTION ERROR<br>NATURE VIA NURTURE<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>ANDERS ERICSSON<br>1947–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Christian Jarrett<br>Biographies of musical geniuses like Mozart and Michael Jackson nearly<br>always reveal that they started relentless practice from an early age.<br>NOMINATIVE DETERMINISM<br>the 30-second theory<br>There’s a urologist at my local hospital called Mr Waterfall. A palliative care<br>expert at Lancaster University is called Sheila Payne, and at the University of<br>New Mexico there’s an expert on the evolutionary psychology of sexuality<br>called Randy Thornhill. The idea that the destiny of these individuals was<br>shaped by their names has been dubbed ‘nominative determinism’. In fact<br>there’s little evidence that the meaning of our names really does influence our<br>career choices – just think of all the people whose names don’t match their<br>professions. However, there are other ways in which our names can affect our<br>lives. For instance, people with surnames near the start of the alphabet tend to<br>enjoy certain benefits, such as being given more time during medical<br>consultations. In economics, in which the authors of papers are listed in<br>alphabetical order, there’s even evidence that people with an alphabetical name<br>advantage have more successful careers. Names that reveal a person’s ethnicity<br>can also exert an influence.

During the<br>1960s, the neuroscientist Roger Sperry discovered that when this bundle is<br>severed, the human brain not only continues to function, but each side is, to<br>some degree, independently conscious. Sperry was studying patients with<br>seemingly untreatable epilepsy who had had their corpus callosum surgically cut<br>in an attempt to stop seizures spreading. Many years before, neuroscientists<br>examining patients with brain damage had discovered that certain functions,<br>such as language, were more reliant on the left hemisphere, whereas visual<br>abilities were more reliant on the right. Sperry realized that ‘split brain’ patients<br>allowed these differences to be explored in detail. He found, for example, that a<br>word presented to the language-specialized left hemisphere was read and<br>understood as normal, whereas a word presented to the language-minimal right<br>hemisphere went unrecognized. But when the task was to draw what the word<br>described, the patient could produce sketches from words presented to the<br>visual-arrangement-specialized right hemisphere, but not the other way around.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>When the brain’s hemispheres are surgically divided, consciousness can be split<br>in subtle and interesting ways.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Popular culture got carried away with Sperry’s discoveries and we often hear the<br>inaccurate idea that the right side of the brain is ‘creative’ while the left side is<br>‘logical’. These are general tendencies, not absolutes, and are about as useful as<br>suggesting that people from one country are ‘emotional’ while those from<br>another country are ‘practical’.

Psychologist Martin Seligman’s prepared learning theory suggests that<br>this is because we have developed a fear system that is ‘prepared’ – sensitive to<br>certain situations due to the effect of evolution. In the modern world, traffic and<br>electrical accidents are major killers, but for the majority of the history of<br>primates (our early ancestors), hazards such as snakes and spiders have been a<br>far greater risk. According to the theory, individual primates who more easily<br>learned to fear the biggest threats were those more likely to survive and pass on<br>their genes – meaning, over time, that we have evolved a genetically based, fearlearning system that is tuned to certain dangers and not others. Seligman came<br>up with his theory in 1970, but years of subsequent experiments have backed up<br>the idea with evidence suggesting that this sensitivity can be detected even in<br>monkeys and babies, so demonstrating its innateness. The theory has also<br>evolved, with more recent versions suggesting that evolution has given us a<br>specific ‘fear module’ that works quickly, automatically and relies on dedicated<br>brain circuits.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>We’ve been shaped by evolution to fear those objects and situations – such as<br>snakes and heights – that were a threat to our distant ancestors.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>While the notion that some fears are more easily learned than others is generally<br>accepted, the claim that this is purely a result of evolutionary processes has been<br>more difficult to prove. As phobias do not typically appear until adolescence or<br>adulthood, it’s possible we are more likely to fear certain things as much because<br>of cultural beliefs, through observing how other people react and warnings given<br>by parents, as through the effect of evolution.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WATSON’S BEHAVIOURISM<br>EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY<br>PAVLOV’S DOGS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>MARTIN E.P.

Although the patients had no conscious control over their symptoms,<br>some could be temporarily ‘cured’ through hypnosis, leading Charcot to believe<br>that the unconscious was blocking access to other functions of the brain. The<br>idea was revolutionary because it brought the idea of the unconscious into the<br>mainstream of medical thought and overturned almost 2000 years of belief that<br>hysteria was a female condition, originally thought by the Ancient Greeks to be<br>caused by a ‘wandering womb’. Two of Charcot’s students extended the<br>concept: Pierre Janet suggested that the mind could ‘dissociate’ or<br>compartmentalize different functions, while Sigmund Freud suggested that this<br>occurred when traumatic memories were converted into physical symptoms as a<br>way of repressing them from the conscious mind. Although there is still little<br>evidence that Freudian repression is responsible, the idea that medical symptoms<br>as serious as blindness and paralysis can be caused by the unconscious mind is<br>now widely accepted.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Striking physical symptoms, such as blindness and paralysis, can be caused by<br>the unconscious mind blocking access to essential brain functions.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Modern neuroscience suggests that ‘hysterical’ or ‘psychogenic’ symptoms, as<br>they are called now, might be caused by the frontal lobes impeding other brain<br>functions. It is still not clear exactly why this happens, but we know that patients<br>with these symptoms often have other emotional difficulties. This suggests that<br>psychogenic symptoms are not working as an effective ‘defence mechanism’, as<br>Freud proposed, but they may be triggered by emotion in other ways.<br>RELATED THEORY<br>PSYCHOANALYSIS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>JEAN-MARTIN CHARCOT<br>1825–1893<br>SIGMUND FREUD<br>1856–1939<br>PIERRE JANET<br>1859–1947<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Vaughan Bell<br>To say that a person’s illness is ‘all in their mind’ doesn’t mean that they are<br>making it up.

He decided to test how well psychiatrists could distinguish between<br>‘sane’ and ‘insane’ people by sending eight friends to hospital emergency rooms,<br>each pretending to hear a voice saying ‘empty’, ‘hollow’, and ‘thud’. All eight<br>were diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to psychiatric hospitals, at<br>which point, following Rosenhan’s earlier instructions, they began to act<br>normally and report that their ‘voices’ had gone. The ‘pseudopatients’ were kept<br>in hospital, often for weeks, while staff consistently interpreted normal<br>behaviour as part of their non-existent illness. When news of the study spread, a<br>local university hospital doubted that it would make such errors so Rosenhan<br>promised to send more fake patients. In reality, he sent none, but in the<br>meantime the hospital had branded more than forty real patients as fakers and<br>another twenty-three were regarded as suspect. The shockwaves from the study,<br>provocatively entitled ‘On Being Sane in Insane Places’, battered the confidence<br>of the medical profession and led to a new system of diagnosis that depends on<br>checklists and scientific studies that test how reliably psychiatrists can use them.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>‘If sanity and insanity exist, how shall we know them?’ asked David Rosenhan’s<br>1973 study, in which fake patients with unlikely symptoms were diagnosed with<br>schizophrenia.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Psychiatrist Robert Spitzer replied that if he drank blood and vomited in an<br>emergency room to fake a peptic ulcer, the staff should not be blamed for being<br>misled and nor should they change the definition of internal bleeding.

Medically<br>speaking, delusions are unfounded yet unshakeable beliefs that are not just a<br>case of being mistaken – they can include states such as believing that your<br>thoughts are being stolen with microwaves, or that secret agents are controlling<br>your actions. Aberrant salience theory, developed by psychiatrist Shitij Kapur,<br>aims to explain how reality starts breaking down in psychosis on the basis that<br>affected people often show changes in the brain’s use of a chemical messenger<br>called dopamine. Kapur argues that the neurochemical is involved in<br>highlighting which things are ‘motivationally important’. In other words, it<br>works like the contrast control on a television, but instead of changing how<br>sharply light and dark stand out from each other, it changes how ‘salient’ or<br>important things seem. For example, normally, if you’re hungry, food grabs your<br>attention to a heightened degree. Aberrant salience theory says that problems<br>with dopamine cause this system to go wrong, with the result that those affected<br>start noticing irrelevant things and believe them to be incredibly important,<br>leading to strange and compelling delusions that alter their behaviour.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>In psychosis, the brain chemical dopamine is overactive causing affected people<br>to perceive irrelevant things as important and attention-grabbing.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The risk of mental illness is not fully explained by what we know about brain<br>chemicals and evidence suggests that a whole host of traits and experiences play<br>a part – including a family history of mental illness, living environment, personal<br>relationships, lifetime stress and even birth complications.

Instead of seeing humans as the<br>passive recipients of experience or slaves to unconscious drives, Maslow saw us<br>as motivated by an ultimate need to become fulfilled and ‘self-actualized’, where<br>we are at peace with ourselves and others and have the psychological freedom<br>‘to become everything that one is capable of becoming’. Humanistic psychology<br>grew from this inspiration and placed subjective lived experience, rather than the<br>unconscious mind, at the centre of human nature. Many psychotherapists<br>pursued these ideas, most notably Carl Rogers, who based ‘client-centred<br>therapy’ on the principles of genuineness and acceptance of a person’s basic<br>worth. Although Maslow was sometimes uncomfortable with how his approach<br>was adopted by the 1960s counter-culture, leading to everything from love-ins to<br>nude psychotherapy, his central themes of respect for individual autonomy and<br>the encouragement of personal development are now at the core of most modern<br>psychological treatments and his ‘hierarchy of needs’ is still considered an<br>important theory of human motivation.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Humans strive for personal growth and self-realization despite the challenges of<br>life, and psychology needs to incorporate these aspects to fully understand<br>human nature.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Although Maslow was critical of the narrow focus of scientific psychology, he<br>always saw the humanistic approach as a complement to it, rather than as a<br>replacement, and remained a little disappointed that his ideas were not more<br>influential among scientists of the time.

Beck’s innovation was to develop cognitive<br>therapy on the basis of scientific studies that tested out common assumptions.<br>This ‘testing out’ approach is also recommended to patients as the treatment is<br>based on the idea – and, in fact, the evidence – that mental illness involves<br>biases in how we perceive, act and think about the world – some of which can be<br>seen in the thoughts that pass through our minds and some of which we might<br>not be aware of. For example, someone suffering from depression might tend to<br>interpret everyday disappointments as a sign that they are ‘worthless’ while<br>someone with a fear of embarrassing themselves in public might avoid social<br>gatherings and so never learn that their worry is unrealistic. A cognitive therapist<br>will work with the client to identify where their thinking and behaviour prevents<br>them from getting better and will help develop strategies to overcome these<br>problems, each of which is tested to see if it helps.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Mental illness involves self-defeating habits of thinking that distort how we<br>make sense of the world. Cognitive therapy allows us to detect these patterns and<br>use alternatives.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>In his early work, Beck had an unfortunate tendency to refer to more ‘rational’<br>ways of thinking, rather than more helpful ways, and this has come under<br>criticism, as ‘rationality’ is a logical ideal that we don’t need in order to be<br>mentally healthy. Furthermore, the style of cognitive therapy doesn’t suit<br>everyone and so it is important to find a type of therapy that suits a person’s<br>personal preferences.<br>personal preferences.<br>RELATED THEORY<br>PSYCHOANALYSIS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>AARON T.

The division, however, is not absolute, but a general<br>trend. Baron-Cohen has collected evidence that, for example, girls can pick up<br>on others’ emotions earlier than boys, while boys can make sense of objects and<br>spatial information at an earlier age. People with autism or a variant, such as<br>Asperger’s syndrome, can be severely impaired at understanding how others<br>think, feel and behave but can be much better at understanding systems. Even in<br>those with learning disabilities, this tendency can express itself as a ‘special<br>interest’ in something such as a transport system, sports statistics or electrical<br>wiring, while, in other cases, it can appear as an exceptional ability in maths,<br>science or computers. Baron-Cohen suspects that people with autism may have<br>been exposed to an excess of testosterone before birth that caused the<br>systematizing tendency to operate at full volume with empathizing barely<br>present. According to Baron-Cohen, this might also explain why autism and its<br>variants are much more common in males.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Autism is an exaggeration of certain male-typical traits, most notably<br>‘systematizing’ – a tendency to try to understand things by their component<br>parts.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Alternative theories suggest that the autistic brain might have a general difficulty<br>with making sense of the ‘big picture’ or that the process of coordinating<br>different mental functions may not be operating smoothly. Indeed, the diagnoses<br>of ‘autism’ and ‘Asperger’s syndrome’ involve social impairment,<br>communication difficulties, and repetitive behaviours and there is now good<br>evidence that these difficulties are not caused by the same things – so the whole<br>evidence that these difficulties are not caused by the same things – so the whole<br>picture is likely to be more complex than just systematizing.<br>RELATED THEORY<br>NEUROPLASTICITY<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>SIMON BARON-COHEN<br>1958–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Vaughan Bell<br>If you seriously enjoy taking watches and radios to bits to find out how they<br>work, then you’re a high scorer in what Baron-Cohen calls ‘systematizing’ – a<br>stereotypically male trait that is often exhibited by people with autism.</p>

<p>THOUGHTS &amp; LANGUAGE<br>THOUGHTS &amp; LANGUAGE<br>GLOSSARY<br>classical conditioning A learning process whereby a response is triggered<br>through association. The most famous example is Pavlov’s dogs. By ringing a<br>bell every time the dog is presented with food, the dog comes to associate the<br>sound of the bell with food and starts to salivate whenever it is rung.<br>coma A deep, often prolonged state of unconsciousness during which the patient<br>is unable to respond to any external stimuli.<br>generative linguistics A school of thought in linguistics which suggests that<br>language has innate structures and rules that are universally understood by all<br>speakers. The idea was developed by Noam Chomsky in the 1960s and sparked a<br>growth in the study of linguistics.<br>global workspace theory An explanation of the way the brain accesses multiple<br>mental functions at the same time. It is usually described as a theatre, with the<br>stage being the conscious mind. A spotlight illuminates the current focus of<br>one’s thoughts, while the rest of the stage is half-lit, representing thoughts on the<br>periphery of the conscious mind. The audience is the passive, unconscious mind<br>observing the performance, while other mental functions perform their duties<br>backstage.<br>long-term memory The brain’s capacity to store information for long periods –<br>possibly an entire lifetime. Short-term memory can become long-term through a<br>process of repetition and meaningful association. Long-term memory divides<br>into two broad categories: episodic (literal memory of events) and semantic<br>(generic skills and information that can be used at different occasions).<br>operant conditioning A learning process whereby behaviour is influenced<br>through a system of reward and punishment. This can take the form of positive<br>or negative reinforcement, in which a reward is given or a penalty removed to<br>encourage certain behaviour. Or it can take the form of positive or negative<br>punishment, whereby a punishment is threatened or a reward is removed to<br>discourage certain behaviour. The theory was developed by US psychologist<br>B.F. Skinner in the 1950s.<br>opioid receptor A group of molecules that painkillers can lock onto and which<br>reduces the ability of a cell to send ‘pain’ messages to the brain. Opioid<br>receptors are found in the spinal column and the medial thalamus area of the<br>brain, both of which are associated with pain detection. ‘Opioid’ refers to any<br>opium-like chemical, so opioid receptor simply means the receiver of opium-like<br>substances.<br>persistent vegetative state The condition of someone who has come out of a<br>coma but shows no signs of awareness, and has not done so for at least four<br>weeks. ‘Vegetative state’ refers to someone who has been in this condition for<br>less than four weeks. Unlike someone in a coma, a patient in a persistent<br>vegetative state can open their eyes and displays sleep-wake cycles. If the<br>condition persists for at least a year, it becomes a permanent vegetative state.<br>phonology The study of the sound system of a language and how these sounds<br>function and convey meaning. This differs from phonetics, which is concerned<br>with the physical way these sounds are produced and received.<br>semantics The study of the meaning of language. Semantics differs from syntax<br>in that it focuses on the meaning given to words and how that relates to the<br>objects they describe, whereas syntax is concerned with the actual structure of<br>language.<br>short-term memory The brain’s capacity to store information for short periods<br>– according to most studies for as little as 20–30 seconds. Short-term memory<br>(also known as working memory) is important for remembering specific<br>information, such as a phone number, before writing it down or consigning it to<br>long-term memory through repetition. It also helps with functional activities,<br>such as remembering what was at the beginning of a sentence when you reach its<br>end.<br>syntax The rules that govern the structure of language. Syntax is not concerned<br>with what the words mean, only how they are arranged and formed.<br>THE PLACEBO EFFECT<br>the 30-second theory<br>Expectations and context play an important role in how we respond to illness<br>and in the effect that treatments have on us. The US anaesthesiologist Henry<br>Beecher noticed this during the Second World War. Injured troops awaiting their<br>return home displayed far less pain than usual. The reason, Beecher surmised,<br>was that their injuries had come to signify a positive outcome. Similarly, the<br>placebo effect is the benefit that arises from merely expecting a treatment will be<br>beneficial. In drug trials, pharmaceutical companies have to test their products<br>against inert sugar pills to show that any benefit is more than just the placebo<br>effect. Some drugs, such as diazepam (for treating anxiety), are more powerful<br>than placebo but only if the patient is told what the drug is for – in other words,<br>the drug acts as a placebo amplifier. Similarly, morphine is less effective if the<br>patient is unaware they are receiving it. The placebo effect is not ‘all in the<br>mind’. In the context of pain it works via the release of the brain’s own inbuilt<br>painkillers – the opioids. If the brain’s opioid receptors are blocked with a drug<br>called naloxone, the placebo effect disappears.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>The mere expectation that a treatment will make you better is enough to set in<br>train beneficial physiological processes in the brain and body.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>The placebo effect has an evil twin known as the nocebo effect. This is when the<br>expectation of harm or pain becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy, even in the<br>absence of any known physical effect.

Stimulants are more<br>effective if they’re red, sedatives work better when they’re blue.<br>PAVLOV’S DOGS<br>the 30-second theory<br>Ivan Pavlov was the Russian scientist who first described this fundamental<br>law of learning. His famous demonstration involved consistently ringing a bell<br>before feeding dogs in his laboratory. After this training, the dogs would salivate<br>merely at the sound of the bell. This experiment demonstrated that the dogs had<br>learned an association between two stimuli – the bell and the food. Learning this<br>kind of association is called ‘classical’, or Pavlovian, conditioning. Classical<br>conditioning doesn’t just occur in dogs. It has been shown in everything from<br>sea slugs to humans. It is important because it is one of the simplest forms of<br>learning, but one that allows us to predict or anticipate what we’re going to<br>experience. It has also been a valuable starting point for neuroscientists<br>interested in the biological basis for memories. Theories of classical<br>conditioning describe how the association between two stimuli strengthens or<br>weakens depending on how often they are presented together, how quickly one<br>is presented before the other and whether any other stimuli are presented.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>If two things repeatedly co-occur, our brains learn to predict one to follow from<br>the other.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Note that classical conditioning doesn’t account for what an animal does – it<br>describes a situation where the stimuli are experienced regardless of how the<br>animal acts. ‘Operant conditioning’ is the counterpoint to classical conditioning<br>and describes situations in which the occurrence of stimuli (e.g. the food) is<br>contingent on the behaviour of the animal (e.g. whether it begs or not).

According to the Sapir–Whorf<br>hypothesis (named after the US linguist Edward Sapir and his student Benjamin<br>Whorf), the reason for this proverbial ability is that Eskimos have many more<br>words for snow than do speakers of other languages. By this account, the words<br>we have at our disposal literally determine what we are capable of thinking and<br>perceiving. The idea proved hugely influential for many decades after Whorf<br>first proposed it in MIT’s Technology Review magazine in 1940. By the 1990s,<br>however, the hypothesis was no longer taken seriously in mainstream circles.<br>The psychologist Steven Pinker even wrote an ‘obituary’ for it in his 1994 book<br>The Language Instinct. Of course if we were only able to think of things for<br>which we had the words, how would we ever learn language in the first place?<br>The Eskimo myth has it the wrong way around – the proverbial Eskimo can’t tell<br>snow types apart because of all the snow words she knows; she uses more snow<br>words because she’s learned to recognize different snow types.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>We can’t think about concepts for which we lack the words.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Although language doesn’t determine what we’re capable of thinking about,<br>there’s no doubt that the conventions of different languages do affect our habits<br>of thought.

For example, ‘I know students like pizza’ could mean (among other<br>things) I’m aware that students enjoy pizza, or that I’m as familiar with students<br>as I am with pizza. When US linguist Noam Chomsky was in graduate school in<br>the 1950s, linguists had no way to explain how each sentence can have many<br>possible meanings. Chomsky argued that this was because spoken or written<br>language was the outward expression of a much deeper mental structure – a<br>‘universal grammar’ – shared by all humans, regardless of their language.<br>Chomsky and his followers believe that grammar has three components:<br>syntactical, phonological and semantic. Of these, only syntax (structure) is<br>fundamental. Phonology (the sound of spoken words) and semantics (the<br>meaning of sentences) are secondary. Syntax reflects the underlying structure of<br>the mind, while phonology and semantics are arbitrary. Paradoxically, syntax is<br>an unconscious mental process; thus, the parts of language that seem most<br>concrete – the words and their meanings – are least interesting to Chomsky. This<br>theory revolutionized linguistics: Chomsky’s ‘generative linguistics’ was<br>flexible enough to explain both the many different meanings of a sentence, and<br>the many different languages in the world.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>All languages share the same broad grammatical principles – a ‘universal<br>grammar’ that is innately understood by all healthy humans and which enables<br>us to acquire language.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>In school, most of us are taught ‘grammar’ that emphasizes the specific rules of<br>our language: add ‘s’ to form a plural, use an apostrophe to indicate a possessive.<br>Chomsky and his followers aren’t interested in these rules, which vary from<br>language to language. Instead, they focus on rules that are common to all<br>languages: sentences include noun phrases and verb phrases, which can be<br>languages: sentences include noun phrases and verb phrases, which can be<br>divided into smaller units or combined into bigger ones, then used to generate<br>actual spoken words.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION<br>EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY<br>SAPIR–WHORF HYPOTHESIS<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>NOAM CHOMSKY<br>1928–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Dave Munger<br>Chomsky believes that all languages share a ‘universal grammar’.

The pioneer in this field is the psychologist<br>Elizabeth Loftus. Her seminal work involved interviewing participants about<br>incidents from their childhood – incidents that they knew had been disclosed<br>earlier to the research team by their parents. Among several true childhood<br>experiences, Loftus inserted the entirely fabricated incident in which the<br>participant had got lost in a shopping centre.

Placing marbles onto a higher shelf,<br>rather than a lower one, makes it easier for people to recall positive stories. And<br>the causal direction can run the other way too, such that our thoughts can affect<br>our perception. Students told that a book was vital to their curriculum<br>subsequently estimated that it was heavier than students told that the book was<br>irrelevant. The strongest advocate for the importance of metaphor is the linguist<br>George Lakoff. He believes we are only able to understand abstract concepts<br>though our use of metaphor.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>We think about abstract concepts, such as time and space, in terms of physical<br>metaphors; in turn, physical sensations can affect our thoughts and beliefs.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Findings in embodied cognition have intriguing implications for the art of<br>persuasion. Study participants tested in a warm room reported feeling socially<br>closer to the experimenter. Participants asked to hold a glass of iced coffee rated<br>a researcher to be more aloof. Holding a heavy clipboard led participants to rate<br>a foreign currency more highly.

Yet most of us are able to follow a single conversation while ignoring all<br>the others. How do we do it? Research by the British scientist Colin Cherry in<br>the 1950s showed that we separate out individual voices by focusing on key<br>characteristics - the speaker’s gender, location and pitch. In 1958, British<br>psychologist Donald Broadbent took this work to a new level with a theory of<br>how the entire brain processes information. Up until then many psychologists<br>believed that humans could only process one thing at a time. Broadbent showed<br>that people could hear and comprehend more than one set of sounds<br>simultaneously - provided they were simple enough. In a classic experiment,<br>Broadbent asked people to listen to two sets of digits (such as ‘659’, ‘842’, and<br>so on), one set played in each ear. Even though the numbers were played at the<br>same time, listeners grouped the digits played through each ear rather than<br>mixing them together. However, once the signals become too complex, a<br>‘bottleneck’ forms, making the signals impossible to manage simultaneously,<br>which is part of the reason it’s dangerous to drive while talking on the phone or<br>texting.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>We are constantly bombarded with sounds, sights and other sensations - yet we<br>can make sense of it all by focusing on small chunks of information.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Broadbent’s original theory said signals that didn’t make it through the<br>bottleneck were simply lost. However, in i960, British psychologist Anne<br>Treisman noted that Broadbent’s theory couldn’t account for the fact that people<br>engrossed in complex tasks could still respond to the sound of their names.<br>Treisman argued that unprocessed signals were actually retained, allowing<br>especially dramatic or important signals to gain our attention.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>WATSON’S BEHAVIOURISM<br>THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION<br>THE LAKE WOBEGON EFFECT<br>MILLER’S SEVEN<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>DONALD BROADBENT<br>1926–1993<br>COLIN CHERRY<br>1914–1979<br>ANNE TREISMAN<br>1935–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Dave Munger<br>If we didn’t have some kind of filter, we’d be caught in a perpetual storm of<br>sensory information.<br>MILLER’S SEVEN<br>the 30-second theory<br>Quick, try to memorize this sequence of letters: UPSBMWCIAIOC. It’s a<br>daunting task until you notice that it’s actually made up of four well-known<br>acronyms: UPS and BMW are companies, and CIA and IOC are organizations.<br>Without breaking the sequence of twelve letters into chunks, you’d have a hard<br>time remembering them all. In 1956, US psychologist George Miller noticed<br>that, although we can remember tens of thousands of items over the long term,<br>the limit for short-term memory tasks such as this one seems to fall consistently<br>around seven items - whether they are numbers, letters, words or even musical<br>tones. But amazingly, Miller’s student, Sidney Smith, was able to teach himself<br>to recall forty random binary digits (zeros and ones) by combining them into<br>chunks eight digits long. Each sequence of digits was like a separate ‘word’ to<br>Smith, so he could remember many more digits than an untrained person.<br>Similarly, we can remember long telephone numbers by chunking the digits into<br>groups. We can quickly learn songs by chunking words into lines and rhyming<br>pairs of lines - and the number of chunks that we can recall over the short term,<br>Miller found, is nearly always very close to seven.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>Under ordinary circumstances, we can remember about seven items at a time -<br>but if we group them together into ‘chunks’, we can remember many more.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>While Miller’s work is quite robust, recent studies have questioned it. Are you<br>really remembering seven chunks, or are you just grouping those chunks into<br>even bigger chunks? In 2001, American psychologist Nelson Cowan argued that<br>the capacity of short-term memory is much less than seven. When we are<br>prevented from making new chunks by working simultaneously on another task,<br>the number of chunks that we can remember is closer to four.<br>RELATED THEORIES<br>THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION<br>BROADBENT’S BOTTLENECK<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHIES<br>NELSON COWAN<br>1951–<br>GEORGE MILLER<br>1920–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Dave Munger<br>The astonishing feats of performers at the annual World Memory<br>Championships show how mnemonics can be used to extend short-term<br>memory way beyond just seven items.<br>CONSCIOUSNESS<br>the 30-second theory<br>We all know what it means to be conscious, but an adequate definition of<br>consciousness remains elusive. The contents of consciousness consist of a<br>narrow, dynamic stream of everything we are presently aware of - our<br>perceptions of the external world and bodily sensations, together with our<br>thoughts, actions, emotions and memories. The contents of consciousness are<br>commonly studied by using brain scanning to compare the brain’s responses to<br>stimuli that enter awareness with those that do not. A common framework for<br>studying these phenomena is the global workspace theory, proposed by Bernard<br>Baars in 1987, which likens consciousness to a working theatre. The vast<br>majority of neural events are unconscious processes taking place ‘behind the<br>scenes’, but some enter into conscious awareness - the ‘stage’ - when they<br>become the focus of an attentional spotlight. The spotlight is surrounded by a<br>fringe of vaguely conscious but crucial events, and acts as a hub which both<br>distributes important information globally and is directed by the unconscious<br>processes taking place behind the scenes. Viewed in this way, consciousness can<br>be thought of as a means by which the brain prioritizes, and gives us access to,<br>the information needed for healthy functioning.<br>3-SECOND PSYCHE<br>A ‘spotlight of attention’ shines a bright beam on certain neural processes, which<br>then enter into conscious awareness.<br>3-MINUTE ANALYSIS<br>Consciousness has long been the subject of debate among neuroscientists and<br>philosophers. Modern brain research is just beginning to provide some<br>understanding of it, and the global workspace theory is the most useful model for<br>interpreting the available evidence. This approach has already provided valuable<br>insight into disorders of consciousness such as coma and the persistent<br>vegetative state, and some suggest that conditions such as schizophrenia involve<br>a profound alteration of processing in the global workspace.<br>a profound alteration of processing in the global workspace.<br>RELATED THEORY<br>MILLER’S SEVEN<br>3-SECOND BIOGRAPHY<br>BERNARD BAARS<br>1950–<br>30-SECOND TEXT<br>Moheb Costandi<br>Although science is beginning to reveal the neural correlates of consciousness,<br>quite how the wet tissue of the brain gives rise to the immaterial mind remains<br>as elusive as ever</p>

<p>This module provides an introduction and overview of the historical development of the science and practice of psychology in America. Ever-increasing specialization within the field often makes it difficult to discern the common roots from which the field of psychology has evolved. By exploring this shared past, students will be better able to understand how psychology has developed into the discipline we know today.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is always a difficult question to ask, where to begin to tell the story of the history of psychology. Some would start with ancient Greece; others would look to a demarcation in the late 19th century when the science of psychology was formally proposed and instituted. These two perspectives, and all that is in between, are appropriate for describing a history of psychology. The interested student will have no trouble finding an abundance of resources on all of these time frames and perspectives (Goodwin, 2011; Leahey, 2012; Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2007). For the purposes of this module, we will examine the development of psychology in America and use the mid-19th century as our starting point. For the sake of convenience, we refer to this as a history of modern psychology.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Psychology is an exciting field and the history of psychology offers the opportunity to make sense of how it has grown and developed. The history of psychology also provides perspective. Rather than a dry collection of names and dates, the history of psychology tells us about the important intersection of time and place that defines who we are. Consider what happens when you meet someone for the first time. The conversation usually begins with a series of questions such as, “Where did you grow up?” “How long have you lived here?” “Where did you go to school?” The importance of history in defining who we are cannot be overstated. Whether you are seeing a physician, talking with a counselor, or applying for a job, everything begins with a history. The same is true for studying the history of psychology; getting a history of the field helps to make sense of where we are and how we got here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="a-prehistory-of-psychology">A Prehistory of Psychology</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Precursors to American psychology can be found in philosophy and physiology. Philosophers such as John Locke (1632–1704) and Thomas Reid (1710–1796) promoted empiricism, the idea that all knowledge comes from experience. The work of Locke, Reid, and others emphasized the role of the human observer and the primacy of the senses in defining how the mind comes to acquire knowledge. In American colleges and universities in the early 1800s, these principles were taught as courses on mental and moral philosophy. Most often these courses taught about the mind based on the faculties of intellect, will, and the senses (Fuchs, 2000).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="physiology-and-psychophysics">Physiology and Psychophysics</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Philosophical questions about the nature of mind and knowledge were matched in the 19th century by physiological investigations of the sensory systems of the human observer. German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) measured the speed of the neural impulse and explored the physiology of hearing and vision. His work indicated that our senses can deceive us and are not a mirror of the external world. Such work showed that even though the human senses were fallible, the mind could be measured using the methods of science. In all, it suggested that a science of psychology was feasible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An important implication of Helmholtz’s work was that there is a psychological reality and a physical reality and that the two are not identical. This was not a new idea; philosophers like John Locke had written extensively on the topic, and in the 19th century, philosophical speculation about the nature of mind became subject to the rigors of science.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The question of the relationship between the mental (experiences of the senses) and the material (external reality) was investigated by a number of German researchers including Ernst Weber and Gustav Fechner. Their work was called psychophysics, and it introduced methods for measuring the relationship between physical stimuli and human perception that would serve as the basis for the new science of psychology (Fancher &amp; Rutherford, 2011).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/618/original.jpg" alt="Wilhelm Wundt" title="Wilhelm Wundt"/><figcaption>Wilhelm Wundt is considered one of the founding figures of modern psychology.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The formal development of modern psychology is usually credited to the work of German physician, physiologist, and philosopher Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920). Wundt helped to establish the field of experimental psychology by serving as a strong promoter of the idea that psychology could be an experimental field and by providing classes, textbooks, and a laboratory for training students. In 1875, he joined the faculty at the University of Leipzig and quickly began to make plans for the creation of a program of experimental psychology. In 1879, he complemented his lectures on experimental psychology with a laboratory experience: an event that has served as the popular date for the establishment of the science of psychology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The response to the new science was immediate and global. Wundt attracted students from around the world to study the new experimental psychology and work in his lab. Students were trained to offer detailed self-reports of their reactions to various stimuli, a procedure known as introspection. The goal was to identify the elements of consciousness. In addition to the study of sensation and perception, research was done on mental chronometry, more commonly known as reaction time. The work of Wundt and his students demonstrated that the mind could be measured and the nature of consciousness could be revealed through scientific means. It was an exciting proposition, and one that found great interest in America. After the opening of Wundt’s lab in 1879, it took just four years for the first psychology laboratory to open in the United States (Benjamin, 2007).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":1} -->
<h1 id="scientific-psychology-comes-to-the-united-states">Scientific Psychology Comes to the United States</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wundt’s version of psychology arrived in America most visibly through the work of Edward Bradford Titchener (1867–1927). A student of Wundt’s, Titchener brought to America a brand of experimental psychology referred to as “structuralism.” Structuralists were interested in the contents of the mind—what the mind is. For Titchener, the general adult mind was the proper focus for the new psychology, and he excluded from study those with mental deficiencies, children, and animals (Evans, 1972; Titchener, 1909).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Experimental psychology spread rather rapidly throughout North America. By 1900, there were more than 40 laboratories in the United States and Canada (Benjamin, 2000). Psychology in America also organized early with the establishment of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1892. Titchener felt that this new organization did not adequately represent the interests of experimental psychology, so, in 1904, he organized a group of colleagues to create what is now known as the Society of Experimental Psychologists (Goodwin, 1985). The group met annually to discuss research in experimental psychology. Reflecting the times, women researchers were not invited (or welcome). It is interesting to note that Titchener’s first doctoral student was a woman, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939). Despite many barriers, in 1894, Washburn became the first woman in America to earn a Ph.D. in psychology and, in 1921, only the second woman to be elected president of the American Psychological Association (Scarborough &amp; Furumoto, 1987).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Striking a balance between the science and practice of psychology continues to this day. In 1988, the American Psychological Society (now known as the Association for Psychological Science) was founded with the central mission of advancing psychological science.</p>

<h1 id="toward-a-functional-psychology">Toward a Functional Psychology</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://nobaproject.com/images/shared/images/000/002/619/original.jpg" alt="Photograph of William James from 1902. " title="Photograph of William James from 1902. "/><figcaption>William James was one of the leading figures in a new perspective on psychology called functionalism. [Image: Notman Studios, CC0 Public Domain, https://goo.gl/m25gce]</figcaption></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Titchener and his followers adhered to a structural psychology, others in America were pursuing different approaches. William James, G. Stanley Hall, and James McKeen Cattell were among a group that became identified with “functionalism.” Influenced by Darwin’s evolutionary theory, functionalists were interested in the activities of the mind—what the mind does. An interest in functionalism opened the way for the study of a wide range of approaches, including animal and comparative psychology (Benjamin, 2007).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>William James (1842–1910) is regarded as writing perhaps the most influential and important book in the field of psychology,&nbsp;<em>Principles of Psychology,</em>&nbsp;published in 1890. Opposed to the reductionist ideas of Titchener, James proposed that consciousness is ongoing and continuous; it cannot be isolated and reduced to elements. For James, consciousness helped us adapt to our environment in such ways as allowing us to make choices and have personal responsibility over those choices.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Harvard, James occupied a position of authority and respect in psychology and philosophy. Through his teaching and writing, he influenced psychology for generations. One of his students, Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930), faced many of the challenges that confronted Margaret Floy Washburn and other women interested in pursuing graduate education in psychology. With much persistence, Calkins was able to study with James at Harvard. She eventually completed all the requirements for the doctoral degree, but Harvard refused to grant her a diploma because she was a woman. Despite these challenges, Calkins went on to become an accomplished researcher and the first woman elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1905 (Scarborough &amp; Furumoto, 1987).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>G. Stanley Hall (1844–1924) made substantial and lasting contributions to the establishment of psychology in the United States. At Johns Hopkins University, he founded the first psychological laboratory in America in 1883. In 1887, he created the first journal of psychology in America, <em>American Journal of Psychology</em>. In 1892, he founded the American Psychological Association (APA); in 1909, he invited and hosted Freud at Clark University (the only time Freud visited America). Influenced by evolutionary theory, Hall was interested in the process of adaptation and human development. Using surveys and questionnaires to study children, Hall wrote extensively on child development and education. While graduate education in psychology was restricted for women in Hall’s time, it was all but non-existent for African Americans. In another first, Hall mentored Francis Cecil Sumner (1895–1954) who, in 1920, became the first African American to earn a Ph.D. in psychology in America (Guthrie, 2003).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>James McKeen Cattell (1860–1944) received his Ph.D. with Wundt but quickly turned his interests to the assessment of individual differences. Influenced by the work of Darwin’s cousin, Frances Galton, Cattell believed that mental abilities such as intelligence were inherited and could be measured using mental tests. Like Galton, he believed society was better served by identifying those with superior intelligence and supported efforts to encourage them to reproduce. Such beliefs were associated with eugenics (the promotion of selective breeding) and fueled early debates about the contributions of heredity and environment in defining who we are. At Columbia University, Cattell developed a department of psychology that became world famous also promoting psychological science through advocacy and as a publisher of scientific journals and reference works (Fancher, 1987; Sokal, 1980).</p>

<h1 id="the-growth-of-psychology">The Growth of Psychology</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, psychology continued to grow and flourish in America. It was large enough to accommodate varying points of view on the nature of mind and behavior. Gestalt psychology is a good example. The Gestalt movement began in Germany with the work of Max Wertheimer (1880–1943). Opposed to the reductionist approach of Wundt’s laboratory psychology, Wertheimer and his colleagues Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), Wolfgang Kohler (1887–1967), and Kurt Lewin (1890–1947) believed that studying the whole of any experience was richer than studying individual aspects of that experience. The saying “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” is a Gestalt perspective. Consider that a melody is an additional element beyond the collection of notes that comprise it. The Gestalt psychologists proposed that the mind often processes information simultaneously rather than sequentially. For instance, when you look at a photograph, you see a whole image, not just a collection of pixels of color. Using Gestalt principles, Wertheimer and his colleagues also explored the nature of learning and thinking. Most of the German Gestalt psychologists were Jewish and were forced to flee the Nazi regime due to the threats posed on both academic and personal freedoms. In America, they were able to introduce a new audience to the Gestalt perspective, demonstrating how it could be applied to perception and learning (Wertheimer, 1938). In many ways, the work of the Gestalt psychologists served as a precursor to the rise of cognitive psychology in America (Benjamin, 2007).</p>

<p>Behaviorism emerged early in the 20th century and became a major force in American psychology. Championed by psychologists such as John B. Watson (1878–1958) and B. F. Skinner (1904–1990), behaviorism rejected any reference to mind and viewed overt and observable behavior as the proper subject matter of psychology. Through the scientific study of behavior, it was hoped that laws of learning could be derived that would promote the prediction and control of behavior. Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849–1936) influenced early behaviorism in America. His work on conditioned learning, popularly referred to as classical conditioning, provided support for the notion that learning and behavior were controlled by events in the environment and could be explained with no reference to mind or consciousness (Fancher, 1987).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For decades, behaviorism dominated American psychology. By the 1960s, psychologists began to recognize that behaviorism was unable to fully explain human behavior because it neglected mental processes. The turn toward a cognitive psychology was not new. In the 1930s, British psychologist Frederic C. Bartlett (1886–1969) explored the idea of the constructive mind, recognizing that people use their past experiences to construct frameworks in which to understand new experiences. Some of the major pioneers in American cognitive psychology include Jerome Bruner (1915–), Roger Brown (1925–1997), and George Miller (1920–2012). In the 1950s, Bruner conducted pioneering studies on cognitive aspects of sensation and perception. Brown conducted original research on language and memory, coined the term “flashbulb memory,” and figured out how to study the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (Benjamin, 2007). Miller’s research on working memory is legendary. His 1956 paper “The Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information”is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. A popular interpretation of Miller’s research was that the number of bits of information an average human can hold in working memory is 7 ± 2. Around the same time, the study of computer science was growing and was used as an analogy to explore and understand how the mind works. The work of Miller and others in the 1950s and 1960s has inspired tremendous interest in cognition and neuroscience, both of which dominate much of contemporary American psychology.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In America, there has always been an interest in the application of psychology to everyday life. Mental testing is an important example. Modern intelligence tests were developed by the French psychologist Alfred Binet (1857–1911). His goal was to develop a test that would identify schoolchildren in need of educational support. His test, which included tasks of reasoning and problem solving, was introduced in the United States by Henry Goddard (1866–1957) and later standardized by Lewis Terman (1877–1956) at Stanford University. The assessment and meaning of intelligence has fueled debates in American psychology and society for nearly 100 years. Much of this is captured in the nature-nurture debate that raises questions about the relative contributions of heredity and environment in determining intelligence (Fancher, 1987).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Applied psychology was not limited to mental testing. What psychologists were learning in their laboratories was applied in many settings including the military, business, industry, and education. The early 20th century was witness to rapid advances in applied psychology. Hugo Munsterberg (1863–1916) of Harvard University made contributions to such areas as employee selection, eyewitness testimony, and psychotherapy. Walter D. Scott (1869–1955) and Harry Hollingworth (1880–1956) produced original work on the psychology of advertising and marketing. Lillian Gilbreth (1878–1972) was a pioneer in industrial psychology and engineering psychology. Working with her husband, Frank, they promoted the use of time and motion studies to improve efficiency in industry. Lillian also brought the efficiency movement to the home, designing kitchens and appliances including the pop-up trashcan and refrigerator door shelving. Their psychology of efficiency also found plenty of applications at home with their 12 children. The experience served as the inspiration for the movie <em>Cheaper by the Dozen</em> (Benjamin, 2007).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Clinical psychology was also an early application of experimental psychology in America. Lightner Witmer (1867–1956) received his Ph.D. in experimental psychology with Wilhelm Wundt and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he opened a psychological clinic in 1896. Witmer believed that because psychology dealt with the study of sensation and perception, it should be of value in treating children with learning and behavioral problems. He is credited as the founder of both clinical and school psychology (Benjamin &amp; Baker, 2004).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the roles of psychologists and the needs of the public continued to change, it was necessary for psychology to begin to define itself as a profession. Without standards for training and practice, anyone could use the title psychologist and offer services to the public. As early as 1917, applied psychologists organized to create standards for education, training, and licensure. By the 1930s, these efforts led to the creation of the American Association for Applied Psychology (AAAP). While the American Psychological Association (APA) represented the interests of academic psychologists, AAAP served those in education, industry, consulting, and clinical work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The advent of WWII changed everything. The psychiatric casualties of war were staggering, and there were simply not enough mental health professionals to meet the need. Recognizing the shortage, the federal government urged the AAAP and APA to work together to meet the mental health needs of the nation. The result was the merging of the AAAP and the APA and a focus on the training of professional psychologists. Through the provisions of National Mental Health Act of 1946, funding was made available that allowed the APA, the Veterans Administration, and the Public Health Service to work together to develop training programs that would produce clinical psychologists. These efforts led to the convening of the Boulder Conference on Graduate Education in Clinical Psychology in 1949 in Boulder, Colorado. The meeting launched doctoral training in psychology and gave us the scientist-practitioner model of training. Similar meetings also helped launch doctoral training programs in counseling and school psychology. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, alternatives to Boulder have been debated. In 1973, the Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology proposed the scholar-practitioner model and the Psy.D. degree (Doctor of Psychology). It is a training model that emphasizes clinical training and practice that has become more common (Cautin &amp; Baker, in press).</p>

<h1 id="psychology-and-society">Psychology and Society</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given that psychology deals with the human condition, it is not surprising that psychologists would involve themselves in social issues. For more than a century, psychology and psychologists have been agents of social action and change. Using the methods and tools of science, psychologists have challenged assumptions, stereotypes, and stigma. Founded in 1936, the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI) has supported research and action on a wide range of social issues. Individually, there have been many psychologists whose efforts have promoted social change. Helen Thompson Woolley (1874–1947) and Leta S. Hollingworth (1886–1939) were pioneers in research on the psychology of sex differences. Working in the early 20th century, when women’s rights were marginalized, Thompson examined the assumption that women were overemotional compared to men and found that emotion did not influence women’s decisions any more than it did men’s. Hollingworth found that menstruation did not negatively impact women’s cognitive or motor abilities. Such work combatted harmful stereotypes and showed that psychological research could contribute to social change (Scarborough &amp; Furumoto, 1987).</p>

<p>Among the first generation of African American psychologists, Mamie Phipps Clark (1917–1983) and her husband Kenneth Clark (1914–2005) studied the psychology of race and demonstrated the ways in which school segregation negatively impacted the self-esteem of African American children. Their research was influential in the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of <em>Brown v. Board of Education,</em> which ended school segregation (Guthrie, 2003). In psychology, greater advocacy for issues impacting the African American community were advanced by the creation of the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) in 1968.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1957, psychologist Evelyn Hooker (1907–1996) published the paper “The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual,” reporting on her research that showed no significant differences in psychological adjustment between homosexual and heterosexual men. Her research helped to de-pathologize homosexuality and contributed to the decision by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1973 (<a href="https://nobaproject.com/modules/history-of-psychology#reference-10">Garnets &amp; Kimmel, 2003</a>).</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Growth and expansion have been a constant in American psychology. In the latter part of the 20th century, areas such as social, developmental, and personality psychology made major contributions to our understanding of what it means to be human. Today neuroscience is enjoying tremendous interest and growth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of the module, it is a challenge to cover all the history of psychology in such a short space. Errors of omission and commission are likely in such a selective review. The history of psychology helps to set a stage upon which the story of psychology can be told. This brief summary provides some glimpse into the depth and rich content offered by the history of psychology. The learning&nbsp;modules in the Noba psychology&nbsp;collection are all elaborations on the foundation created by our shared past. It is hoped that you will be able to see these connections and have a greater understanding and appreciation for both the unity and diversity of the field of psychology.</p>

<p><em>“You cannot lose a person, only their body, for the rest of them can be found in your heart and mind.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="h.vi67xmikl1i8">Memory</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Memory</strong>&nbsp;refers to the processes that are used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are three major processes involved in&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Human&nbsp;<strong>memory</strong>&nbsp;involves the ability to both preserve and recover information we have learned or experienced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Process of memory-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Encoding</strong>&nbsp;- encoding is defined as the initial learning of information.</li><li><strong>Storage&nbsp;</strong>- it refers to maintaining information over time.</li><li><strong>Retrieval</strong>&nbsp;- retrieval/recall is the ability to access information when you need it.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Types of memory-:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sensory memory</strong><strong>-</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The sensory register holds sensory information for a few seconds.</li><li>Has a relatively large capacity, storing a copy of the sensory input.</li><li>Loses information through a process involving the decay of the memory trace.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Types of sensory memory-</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong><em>Iconic 👁️ &nbsp;memory</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- it is the visual sensory memory register pertaining to the visual domain and fast decaying store of visual information.</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li><strong><em>Echoic 🔊 &nbsp;memory</em></strong><em>&nbsp;- it is sensory memory that registers specific to auditory information once an auditory stimulus is heard, it is stored in memory so that it can be processed and understood</em>.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Short term memory</strong>-&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>short term memory holds a relatively small amount of information.</li><li>It has less than 30 second capacity.</li><li>The type of information stored consists of sounds, images, words or sentences.</li><li>information is lost from short term memory by being displayed by new inputs.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Long term memory</strong>-</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Information in the long term memory lasts for days, months, years, or even a lifetime.</li><li>The capacity of long term memory has no known limit.</li><li>Memories of specific things that have happened, or episodic memory and the meaning of words and the rules for using them or semantic memory are stored in long term memory.</li><li>Information may be lost or at least not retrieved from long term memory because of difficulties with the search process or because of interference by other long term memory.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Types of long term memory-</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong><em>Declarative memory</em></strong><em>- a type of memory recollection of particular facts and events.</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Types of declarative memory.</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong><em>Episodic memory</em></strong><em>- episodic memory stores personal experiences.</em></li><li><strong><em>Semantic memory-</em></strong><em>&nbsp;episodic memory stores information about facts.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li><strong><em>Non declarative memory</em></strong><em>- it is acquired and used unconsciously and can affect thought and behaviours.</em></li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><em>Procedural memory- it is a type of non declarative memory which aids the performance of particular types of tasks without conscious awareness of these previous experiences. Procedural memory guides the processes we perform and must frequently reside below the level of conscious awareness.</em></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FORGATTING</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to&nbsp;<strong>Hermann Ebbinghaus</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>“No matter how thoroughly a person may have learned the greek alphabet, he will never be in a condition to repeat backwards without further training.”</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inability to recall or recognise material which was previously stored in memory is called<strong>&nbsp;forgetting</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><em>Factors of forgetting-</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Encoding failures</strong>&nbsp;- we don’t learn the information in the first place.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2"><li><strong>Decay</strong>&nbsp;- memories fade over time.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3"><li><strong>Inadequate retrieval cues</strong>&nbsp;- we lack sufficient reminders.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":4} -->
<ol start="4"><li><strong>Interference</strong>&nbsp;- other memories get in the way.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":5} -->
<ol start="5"><li><strong>Trying not to remember</strong>&nbsp;- we deliberately attempt to keep things out of mind.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->
